The Serie V Melanio is considered one of the brand\u2019s \u201cPremium\u201d Cigars.   The long filler tobaccos are a blend of Oliva Nicaraguan Habano that emphasizes tobacco from the Jalapa region, an area known for a more nuanced leaf than the Esteli or Condega regions.Appearance :  (4.75) This petit corona comes box pressed.

I used a straight guillotine cut and the cigar handled this cut very well. The burn remained consistent and even throughout.  It should be noted that this Serie V Melanio arrived in my humidor in late fall of last year so it has rested nicely over the winter and stabilized perfectly. This had to have contributed to the noticeably even burn throughout.This cigar was not firmly packed.  In fact, a quick pre-smoke inspection revealed that the cigar was actually quite spongy in feel.  This, despite being stored at between 65-68% RH which is my preferred smoking RH.   The pre-light draw was a tad loose for my liking offering no resistance whatsoever.   Deduction was for the very loose construction.  Otherwise the cigar held up quite admirably and burned like a dream, only slightly wavering at the occasional point but it self-corrected wonderfully without ever needing any touch up whatsoever.  Minor deductions were made for the seam/cap and for the tad open draw.Flavor :  The pre-light aroma was very pleasant with hints of cedar, natural tobacco and pleasant coffee and toffee notes. The pre-light draw was very open with some pleasing sweetness and only a hint of salt and spice on the lips. The cigar was lightly packed and felt a tad spongy.  I was concerned that this very loose draw would play havoc with my cigar.  Let\u2019s see what it did.Oliva Serie V Melanio Petit Corona held up well to my guillotine straight cut. I toasted the foot with my single torch flame and was greeted with a very pleasing and sweet cigar aroma.Be ready because the first couple of puffs greet you with a spicy kick and it can be a tad overwhelming if you aren\u2019t ready for it. I best describe the spice as cayenne pepper spice, not black pepper spice. It had a pleasant finish with hints of caramel/toffee and sweet cocoa coming through. The spice hit the front and back of the palate and tended to linger longer than normal at the back of my throat.  It certainly offered some spicy \"tickle\" if I may. The draw was effortless but in all truthfulness, it was a little too loose and open for my liking.  As a result, smoke this one slow because it does have a tendency to burn fast because of that loose draw. I like a bit more resistance in my cigars.The first third of the cigar was quite complex and I give the cigar an A+ for the first third after getting over the kick of spice with the first couple of puffs.  The cigar had tremendous smoke output however, the smoke was very dry, lacking any creamy or velvety richness that one might expect with such thick smoke output.  I would recommend a nice cool beverage handy, something sweet like an iced tea would pair nicely with this because, as I will get into later, you will need some sweetness to balance what is to come later.The flavor during the first third was a pleasing blend of cedar, black cherry, tea, and the occasional hint of caramel complimented with some mild salt on the lips. The first third came to an end with consistent thick smoke output and the burn was perfect.  Again, if I had one complaint it was the openness of the draw. Despite this though, the cigar never got hot and remained complex during the first third. The first third was definitely full flavored, smooth (apart from the initial spicy hit) and complex.By the end of the first third the spice had decreased significantly when compared to the initial burst. The burn remained beautiful and the white/grey ash held together nicely, never flaking and holding up well until it finally broke off near the end of the first third.As I started the second third and until I approached the halfway point of the cigar I noted a significant drop-off in the spice but don't exhale through your nose unless you want a spicy kick. This little cigar packs quite the spicy punch if retro-haled.At the halfway point the cigar continued to provide thick white clouds of smoke but again, the draw was just too open for my liking.  The cigar, not as complex as the first third, did exhibit some notes of unsweetened coffee, caramel and wood.  Leathery notes started to become more prominent. The woodsy flavors shifted from what started as cedar tones to more oaky notes.  Some bitterness started to creep into the profile which at first reminded me of unsweetened espresso but became harsher near the halfway point.Just past the halfway point and until I approached the final third is where the flavors started to fall apart for me. There was no more salty flavor on my lips and despite the smoke remaining nice and thick, it lacked any texture to it whatsoever. The burn remained flawless but the finish was extremely dry and left me \u2018parched\u2019 on many puffs. The finish was not as long and it was harder to really find some flavors that were worth making note of. Overall, a considerable amount of bitterness started to dominate the stick with more woodsy/grassy/hay overtones.  There were some mild notes of black cherry and unsweetened coffee but overall, this portion of the cigar was dominated by \u2018plain\u2019 woodsy and grassy notes.By the time I hit the final third and until I decided to finally lay the cigar to rest, the flavors had become muted and very one dimensional.  Wood and damp hay dominated the rest of the cigar with an unpleasant bitterness on almost every puff.  Only very mild hints of spice remained and the cigar quickly deteriorated into a rather bland and bitter smoke.The cigar at this point was very dry and bitter on the palate. A little more pepper re-emerged but the cigar as a whole lacked any discernible sweetness to balance the bitterness that had taken over the flavor profile. This is why I recommended a sweet beverage to help with the dryness and to balance the bitterness that took over for the last 30% of the cigar.  Any complexity that was present in the first third and that crept through on occasion in the second third was completely gone.  The cigar rapidly became quite woodsy and grassy.  I also made a point of smoking it slow because of the very loose draw.  I did not want the Melanio to get hot and, to its credit, it never did, staying cool the entire duration of the experience.I must say that the final third was not enjoyable. While the smoke output and burn remained exceptional, the flavor was taken over by the bitterness one gets in burnt espresso.  The flavors became bland with only wood and damp hay dominating the flavor profile.   The finish was uninspiring. While some peppery spice re-emerged I just couldn't get over the bitterness that came back with a vengeance near the end.Value :  Value is subjective and often remains one of the most contentious part of any review.  If one really enjoys a cigar then a smoker will have no problem paying the price.  If the experience is not enjoyable then the price has to be right in order to pick one up, even on the fly when nothing else might be available.

The cigar took no time whatsoever to open up at the beginning but all the positives turned to negatives and as such, the consistency of the smoke left a lot to be desired.Positives included the outstanding burn and smoke output as well as a very enjoyable and beautifully complex first third of the cigar.  Negatives were the loose draw, the lack of complexity from roughly the halfway point onward and the transformation to a bitter cigar not to mention the fact that the cigar\u2019s incredible and thick smoke output lacked any real texture to it but instead contributed to a very dry smoking experience leaving me parched on many occasions.  I would rate the cigar\u2019s strength as medium.  A seasoned cigar smoker can get away with smoking this on an empty stomach as I for example only started to feel the nicotine in the final third. More novice smokers should perhaps have something to eat first.  The cigar makes a nice short smoke when time is limited.  As noted above, the first portion of the cigar was full bodied, complex and smoothed out nicely after I got past the spicy kick that greeted me on lighting.  Strength throughout was considered medium.  Unfortunately, the smooth and full bodied tastes were only there for less than half of the cigar. As such, this is reflected in my flavor rating.", "flavor": " The pre-light aroma was very pleasant with hints of cedar, natural tobacco and pleasant coffee and toffee notes.

The cigar line that we are reviewing is the O.S.O.K. (One Shot One Kill) 212 NYC Limited Exclusive.  And we have made yet another addition to our fine group of reviewers.  Now joining my Father Nick Sr., Neal and myself (Nick  Jr.) will be Ricky in his very first official review with us.   Now a little O.S.O.K. history\u2026The O.S.O.K. 212 NYC is an addition (though a limited exclusive) to the original O.S.O.K line.  The O.S.O.K. line is a spin-off/addition to the Room 101 line (a joint venture between Camacho Cigars and Pete Johnson of Tatuaje Cigars).  The Room 101 brand is owned by Camacho Cigars which in turn is now owned by The Oettinger Davidoff Group (Zino Davidoff Cigars).  Got all that?  But this is all about the O.S.O.K. 212 NYC.  Only 3,000 cigars in 10 count boxes are being produced across the 4 vitola line which shows just how limited this stick is!  The 212 series, (212 is the area code in Manhattan.  A tribute to New York City.), consists of two diademas (commonly referred to as salomons) and two parejos (standard vitola shape).The Cigar Inn has been working very hard to provide only the very best to its clientele.  Through very careful and thorough screening they have decided that the O.S.O.K. 212 NYC was the perfect cigar to represent the Cigar Inn name.  Matt Booth, founder of Room 101 has also expressed his excitement in bringing this unique stick to The Cigar Inn.  It is a top shelf stick that belongs in a top shelf shop, and Mr. Booth has found that in The Cigar Inn and its owners, the Fakih brothers: Billy, Bass and Gus.  And you will never meet a nicer bunch of guys!Now, on to the reviews\u2026The original O.S.O.K. is comprised of an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, Honduran Corojo Seco binder and a blend of Honduran and Dominican Corojo and Piloto Ligero as its filler.  The difference between the original and the new exclusive 212\u2026 the 212 is a maduro!  In general, if you are familiar with the taste of the original O.S.O.K., add a pronounced spicy sweetness.  But all four sticks in this line (the Filero, Chingonazo, Pedaso and Chingon) smoke very differently, and yield their own special highlights.O.S.O.K 212 NYC Filero 4 \u00bd\u201d x 42 x 52 diadema, $12.50/stick.  Reviewed by Ricky.The O.S.O.K 212 Filero has represented the City Of New York very well.The dressing of the 212 was unique.  It was covered from foot to head in Aztec-like  Artwork, but only to reveal another layer of tissue paper that was twisted on both ends.  Finally, the black and silver band read O.S.O.K.  Holding the cigar, a dark brown wrapper, rich with an oily sheen.The 212 lit easily.  My initial draw was smooth and clear.  The white cloud of smoke produced a mild chocolate aroma into the air.  After a few puffs, the cigar gave off earthy flavors.Observing the first third, the construction of the 212 was tough and durable.  The cigar burned at a mild and evenly pace, producing a nice volume of smoke.  My draws continued smooth and clear.  The salt and pepper ash held up firm with a minor split.Halfway into the 212, it grabs my attention with unexpected changes to the earthy note.  My palate accepting every bit of taste, as it continued to the end.I really enjoyed and recommend the O.S.O.K 212 Filero.  I had no problems with this cigar.   The 212 remained level with a boost at the end.  I will definitely enjoy another when I visit the Fakih brothers at the Cigar Inn.O.S.O.K. 212 Chingonazo 6\u201d x 60 parejo, $15.00/stick.  Reviewed by Nick, Sr.Now that was a memorable Stick!  Of course I am referring to the OSOK 212 Chingonazo (6 X 60).Packaging was the first hint of something great about to happen!  No disappointment... the cigar was very firm with an ever so slight hint of chocolate aroma.  Too often disappointed but once this baby was torched, I was treated to a fabulous first draw.  Clean, smooth with zero nasty aftertaste, only mild flavor right from the start.  If you are searching for a great smooth mild smoke which totally complements a \"Grey Goose on the rocks\", this 212 does the trick!!One third into it, the chocolate flavor and mild aroma are dominant.The smooth draw absolutely satisfies my preference for slow pleasure!  At the halfway point my 212 is yielding the same consistent mild taste and draw.  At about the 2/3 point I am now tasting a combination of coffee and chocolate.Throughout the entire stick, the draw remained fabulous and never a \"bite\" to be experienced!!  I really loved the fact that this beauty continued to yield positives and never kicked my butt!The 212 was one of the finest smokes at this price point... It will NOT disappoint!The O.S.O.K. 212 Pedaso 6.25\u201d x 54 parejo, $15.00/stick.  Reviewed by Neal.First, the packaging is very, very cool. With a paper outer wrapper, then tissue, then a double banded cigar, the presentation is great. This is the first time I ever had several of my fellow cigar club members come over, pick up the packaging and ask, \u201cWhat is that?\"The construction is very solid, densely rolled, no soft spots and excellent draw. The initial light renders ample smoke, spicy on the nose while creamy on the tongue. The ash, grey and tight, holds well. The OSOK 212 has beautiful medium tobacco flavors, oily wrapper with a consistently excellent, draw and burn from start to finish.This cigar is well balanced, seems to be nicely aged and burns nice and slow.  As the cigar warms up, you begin to sense chocolate on the aroma while taste continues to be creamy.Some cigars become the event vying for your attention, and some cigars make the moment, like the perfect wine at dinner. If you want to relax and enjoy a little serenity, this is the cigar.The O.S.O.K. 212 Chingon 8\u201d x 44 x 60 diadema, $16.50/stick.  Reviewed by Nick, Jr.The pre-light aroma was a subtle mocha wisp in the air.  Just enough to be detected.  Holding this cigar, one notices the perfect construction and dark chocolate colored wrapper.  The torpedo cap cut cleanly and fire was put to the foot.Immediate notes of earth and leather were detected through the prefect draw of this 8\u201d salomon.   Its burn was even, and continued to stay so throughout the life of the cigar.At about the halfway point the flavor began to notch up a bit.  But as the earthy and clean tobacco notes became more potent some new flavors were introduced.  Touches of semi-sweet chocolate and spice made themselves known.The cigar continued to hold up well with a perfect burn, a firm salt & pepper ash and a clean draw with ample smoke.  This cigar was really living up to my expectations.  It was fantastic to this point and only got better!As the cigar was brought to the nub, the flavors of spice and chocolate took over.  An incredible finish to one heck of a cigar!  I tend to give the highest accolades to full bodied sticks, and this cigar, though it really only cracked through the high medium mark, deserves all the praise that a cigar can garner.  At $16.50 per stick I will happily go back over and over to revisit this experience.It\u2019s thumbs up all around for Camacho, O.S.O.K. and the Fakih Brothers at The Cigar Inn.  This is a 4 star stick that you will not regret giving an hour of your time to.  Keep in mind that this is not only an exclusive, but it is VERY limited.

Top notch,... nothing else expected coming from the Carrillos.1st Third- No pepper, just sweet spice, cinnamon, earth, and woodsy flavors. 2nd Third- Bit of pepperiness, but a lovely floral quality comes out with earth and wood. 3rd Third- A whole lotta earth and wood with touches of leather and cedar. Finishes medium+ bodied.It tastes somewhat similar to EP Carrillo's core line but with more body and earthiness. It's a good cigar, but just doesn't have enough uniqueness to warrant a box purchase for me. If you like Ernesto's stuff then this is a must try. The balance is very good with nothing overpowering other elements of the cigar. Superb with a lowland Scotch.

Litto Gomez Diez has received plenty of positive press for his creativity; Cigar Aficionado even stated he is \u201carguably the most innovative mind in the cigar business.\u201d Diez was previously a jewelry maker but started his cigar business after being robbed at gunpoint for nearly half a million dollars worth of jewelry merchandise.  Diez says that it took about two decades to perfect his creative process, but now his brand is world famous.  Each year La Flor Dominicana puts out a Limitado cigar available in just 2,000 boxes with 48 cigars in each.   The Limitado is consequently kind of difficult to find; you may be able to find it for as little as $10.00, but you\u2019ll have to search.Appearance :  La Flor Dominicana Limitado IV is devoid of large veins and feels firm, but not hard.

The Camacho Liberty 2009 was released in July of 2009, and only 40,000 of these were made.  The filler and binder are grown in the Eiroa\u2019s farm in Jamastran, Honduras.  For those lucky enough to have a cigar from each release, this would be an interesting comparison among all of them.  This is my first experience with the Liberty brand.Appearance :  The cigar is a nice semi dark chocolate; although the cigar looked dull, it felt like it was very soft to the touch.The cigar comes in a very nice wooden coffin, and each cigar is numbered; this one was cigar number 27,143 out of 40,000.  Each cigar also comes individually wrapped in tissue paper.The cigar featured two bands:  one at the foot and the traditional one closest to the head.  The band at the foot had \u201cLiberty 2009\u201d written on it, and it featured a crown and the red \u201cC\u201d trademarked by Camacho cigars.The band at the head was much larger in size than traditional bands; it was pretty elaborate featuring red, black, gold, and white colors and other designs.Construction :  The cigar featured 2.5 veins running the length of the cigar.  It also seemed that it was double capped, although a third cap may be present and just very difficult to see.One soft spot was noticed towards the middle of the cigar; however, the cigar felt very firm to the touch.The cigar had a pretty easy draw both on pre-light and during the smoke.During the smoke, the cigar burned pretty even for the first third of the cigar; after that, I experienced a canoeing effect; this was disappointing, especially for such a pedigreed cigar.  The ash looked light grey, and it seemed a bit loose as the cigar felt tightly packed to the touch.  The cigar was pretty smoky, and the smoke rose and dissipated rather quickly.Flavor :  This cigar featured quite a complex flavor profile.  On pre-light, raisins were tasted on the draw; a slight hint of sweet spices were also detected.  A light spice was felt on the tongue.The cigar was cut with a Boston Cigar Company \u201cLittle Guy\u201d V-cutter, and the first draw feature roasted nuts and coffee flavors.  On retrohale, some woody notes (oak), were also found.Towards the second half of the cigar, the oak and coffee notes became more pronounced, and to me, they became more balanced.I would say that the cigar started out as a full strength cigar, but then, it seemed to mellow out as the smoking experience continued.Value :  This is, by no means, a cheap smoke.  It is what I call a \u201cspecial occasion\u201d cigar.  To determine its true value, one should smoke other cigars in the Liberty brand and compare the smoking experience to the 2009.  I typically do not have these high end smokes in my humidor, but I wanted to try these Camacho Liberty series cigars.  I tried getting the 2008 release, but the release seems to be sold out.One thing I can say is that for ~$20.00 per cigar, I would have expected the construction to be a bit better.  The flavor profile brings a good value to the cigar.Overall Rating :  The Camacho Liberty 2009 release is a good smoke considering the price per cigar.  The complex, yet balanced flavors, upset the construction issues encountered in the cigar.  My expectations for this cigar were very high, and to me, such a hyped-up, expensive cigar should just be perfect.However, it was a very pleasant and enjoyable smoke.  If you can find them, grab a few and compare them to next year\u2019s release.  A fun exercise would be to revisit the 2009 release and compare it to the 2010 one.  The 2008 would have been fun to get as it features a barber pole wrapper, but I was not so lucky.  So, I will sit tight and wait until July for the next release of the brand.This post was written by Ed.

The vintage concept is similar to wine, each vintage being significantly different from another. As far as I remember, one was even able to buy \"futures\" of the La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 series. To my knowledge, these cigars were relased in 2008 and 2009, while the 2010 release was delayed and still hasn't hit the shelves (correct me if I'm wrong).The 2008 first size, La V\u00e9rit\u00e9, is a 7 x 47 Churchill and is the commanding ship of the entire project.  This vitola was available in boxes of 10, 25, 50, and master cases of 100.  The second, L'Esprit de V\u00e9rit\u00e9, is a 5 x 50 Robusto that is blended to be a lighter smoke.  It was only available in boxes of 10 and 25. I think these are still available at some retailers, but of course at higher prices than initial MSRP (at least $15 per stick).All of the La V\u00e9rit\u00e9 cigar line is rolled in Nicaragua at the My Father Cigar Factory.  These cigars in particular were rolled sometime between March 30, 2009 and July 03, 2009.  Just like great single vintage wines, these cigars offer the aficionado the opportunity to sample cigars grown from the same crop in a vintage setting.The pre-light ritual for the L\u2019esprit de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 was enjoyable.  The first thing that stood out for me was the feeling of the cigar.  I know, not typically one of the first things that catches a smoker's attention, but the cigar felt good, meaning it had a good weight and touch when holding it.The wrapper was veiny and toothy with a nice chocolate hue.  The cap was a little rough looking however, the band, being very simple, was attached neatly and the color scheme/size worked well with the cigar.  Pre-light smell gathered notes of a sweet, cedar, woodiness and the cold draw showed a perfect resistance accompanied by no definite tasting notes.Upon the first few draws the cigar came across bold.  This didn\u2019t last long as it quickly settled down into the medium bodied range.  The perfect draw on the L\u2019esprit de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 gave way to a velvety smoke that seemed to dance in the air.  The aroma was mildly sweet and very satisfying.  This fast burning cigar gave way to a toasty, meaty, leathery first third that can now only be remembered by its snow-white ash.Throughout the second third, the characteristics remained meaty and leathery with a touch of musty old textbook noted through the sinuses.  The cigar remained medium bodied and the inconsistent burn always corrected itself.The final third of my L\u2019esprit de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 was briefly interrupted because the cigar's band would not come off.  Typically the heat from the cigar loosens the glue enough to allow me to slip the band right off but this was not the case.  Eventually, I was able to remove the band without damaging the wrapper leaf of the cigar but wow, what a task it proved to be.  The tasting notes again remained the same with the final third of the cigar, not offering much besides an old leathery characteristic.My overall impression of the L\u2019esprit de V\u00e9rit\u00e9 is it tended to lack complexity throughout its tasting profile by remaining the same throughout the smoking experience.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, consistency is a good thing but, when it comes to tasting cigars, complexity is a better play in my book.  I suggest trying this cigar, however, at the hefty price tag I won\u2019t be stocking them in my humidor.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 7 pts. Overall Experience: 6 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

It has an oily sheen and plenty of small veins crawling across its surface.  It is firm and well filled.  I don\u2019t know why but it looks large.  It is a toro just like the maduro I smoked, but for some reason, maybe it is its ample heft, this cigar just looks like a monster smoke.  It starts off with spice and pepper and it is a little tannic.  It has a short finish with a hint of sweetness.  It has a very full feel on the palate letting me know right off that this is going to be a robust smoke.  That is what I was thinking at the start.  It mellowed out a bit once I got about two inches into the smoke.  The spice and pepper faded, replaced by a strong woody core complimented by leather and black coffee.  I picked up flashes of clove every now and then.  It didn\u2019t really change until I neared the end where it started to pickup again.  It got very spicy and full like it was at the start.  The sweetness in the finish remained consistent for the duration of the smoke.I agree that this cigar is not for beginners but once again, like with the maduro, I found the \u201cFor Professional Smokers\u201d label to be more hype than anything else.  It isn\u2019t any more powerful and robust that a Camacho Corojo.  It is a full bodied and robust cigar but I didn\u2019t find it to be over the top in power.  I thought it was a decent smoke but not something I feel compelled to smoke again.  I enjoyed the Maduro and the Lite much more than the Corojo.

Size : 6 x 54 Wrapper : Nicaragua (Habano 99 Hybrid) Filler : Honduras Binder : Honduras Hand-Made Price : $6.50 eachAvailable from the Los Nietos website...Many thanks to Joel from Los Nietos cigars for providing a sampler for this review.At first glance, the Luca Del Toro is a very picturesque cigar.  There are some slight veins but with nearly invisible seams and a bold looking wrapper it creates a perfect image.  A golden bull, after the cigar\u2019s namesake, stands out on the band\u2019s stark white field while its block gold lettering reminds me of the styles adorning old time Western movie posters.  The full length of this cigar is firm and solid without much give and the foot exudes a distinct caramel scent, which is extremely pleasant.After cutting the head and taking a pre-light draw, I find the draw to be lighter than expected but nothing to be concerned about.  It reveals a slight note of spice and earthy undertone.  After lighting the smoke the caramel scent comes through yet the pre-light spice lingers on the tongue thus making a perfectly blended flavor combination.  Exhaling through the nose has the unique effect of enhancing the caramel and subduing the spice.  Typically the spice is accentuated by doing this so I find this to be an interesting reversal.The aforementioned appearance and perceived construction carries over into the smoke itself.  A very even burn releases billowing white smoke and leaves behind a tight gray ash.   After a short while the caramel and spice are accompanied by a coffee tone just short of espresso, similar to a full city roast.  Combined, the flavors are very bold but evenly round each other out.  The spice, which I actually believe to be nutmeg based on its prominent smell, lends substance to the sweetness.  Towards the second third the burn takes on a distinct wave due to one of the aforementioned veins.  Rotating the cigar causes the burn to eventually right itself, however.Through the second third there is not much change in the flavor with the exception of one awkward moment where the taste dropped off almost completely and seemed rather empty.  I let it mellow for a short while and the flavors returned again so it may have just gotten slightly too hot or hit a loose spot.  Approaching the final third I notice that my neighbor, who is an avid rabbit lover, is out in the yard attempting to train his fairly new pet on the finer points of boundaries.  The neighbor\u2019s method consists of chasing the mischievous bunny through the neighboring field with a fishing net attempting to corral it.  Chuckling to myself I turn my focus back to the cigar.Just into the start of the last third a strawberry fruit flavor comes out to join the others.  The temperature begins to cool down around this point so I brew a quick cup of Lady Earl Gray tea to take the edge off.  This pairing proves perfect and finishes out the already good smoke delightfully.Overall this cigar is solid in all regards.  I enjoyed the blend of flavors, with the one exception mentioned earlier on and it managed to stay burning strong.  To provide more depth to this review, I had one cigar leftover and gave it to my father for his input as well.  He was impressed with the smoke as a whole but the burn and construction really stood out to him.  To date this is the only cigar I have had from Los Nietos but as they have managed to turn out a very fine product I will be looking for additional lines to try in the future.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (4.25)This post was written by Joe K.

Several draws in, there's a nice black pepper that picks up considerably and then falls off.

It's there but you can only taste it if you're focused on it.  The strongest flavor in the last third is toasted nuts.Burn / Draw :  No issues from toast to finish on this one.

The name also has a reputation for quality and excellence.  There is a lot of great information about the man and the company on their website Davidoff.com.  One other commonly held perception of Davidoff is mild cigars and there are many smokers in the cigar community that mistake \u201cmild\u201d to mean \u201cflavorless\u201d.  The Special R is the first Davidoff cigar I have had the pleasure of trying.  No matter what line of Davidoff Cigars you might be interested in, the fact is they are all pretty expensive, almost universally costing more than $10 a piece.  With my predisposition towards strong robust cigars, I admit that I allowed their mild reputation and lofty price tag keep me away up until now.I have a friend who is a fan of Davidoff and more precisely their blender Henke Kelner.  I have listened to him rail against the the idea that Davidoff only makes mild cigars and one of the lines he liked to use as an example of a more robust offering is the \u201cSpecial\u201d line of Davidoff cigars.  So I was happy to be able to review this particular Davidoff.  The Special R is not a mild cigar.  I found it to be a solid medium bodied smoke with robust flavors balanced by excellent subtleties making for an engaging smoke.  A core of smooth and chewy flavors of espresso and earth were complemented by more subtle notes of oak and nuts and an almost buttery feel on the palate.  At times I picked up flashes of slightly sweet, almost caramel like notes on the finish.  The construction was exquisite with a perfect burn, nice ash, and a spot on draw.  I found the Davidoff Special R to be a very enjoyable, elegant smoke.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Not that I agree with you one bit, but I know a lot of people who are strictly Cuban cigar smokers.

For me, a Cuban cigar will never be able to hold it\u2019s own after eating a huge steak, that is a job for a full bodied Nicaraguan. But if I want to sit back and relax with a Mojito or sip a lowland scotch then only a Cuban cigar seems to be a logical choice. I don\u2019t know how many non Cuban cigars you have smoke Jmorena or where you live but I can assure you there are non cubans that compete wholeheartedly with their Cuban brothers. A Buena Vista EL 2008, Quesada Espana, or Rodrigo Habano Clasico provide awesome cubanesque flavors that are better than 80% of the Cubans on the market (plus they don\u2019t have to be aged to taste good). Don\u2019t get me wrong, I love cubans but the fact they aren\u2019t prime to smoke for a year or more after purchase poses a problem for a lot of the smoking population.

The typical classy white band adorns the cigar with a simple \u201cSpecial R\u201d stamped on its side. The wrapper smells of sweet tobacco mixed with musk and wood. Vanilla, honey, and musk characterize the aromas of the foot of the cigar. One of the best smelling cigars on the market.Construction :  Everyone lauds Davidoff\u2019s construction. In my experience as a smoker, they have always been mediocre at best. I can name many other brands that have better construction. The Special R\u2019s for the review were nicely packed with tons of filler and had no soft spots. I cut it with my guillotine cutter and the dry draws were quite airy on one of the samples (the others were perfectly resistant). The cigar produced a very light grey ash and good amounts of thick creamy smoke. Past midway, the openness of the cigar tended to tighten up nicely and the smoking experience improved. With three inches into the photographed sample the wrapper busted and split, but this did not pose a smoking problem. The burn was pretty even throughout all the smoking experiences seldom needing any touch ups.Flavor :  Honey and allspice is tasted on the dry draw. After sparking the Special R, sweet honey and vanilla smoke is emitted. The smoke is thin from the start but very smooth, and transitions to a thicker creamier experience later on down the line. Light to medium bodied is where I would place this on the strength scale. Lemon and meringue flavors start to come out nearing the 2nd third.The 2nd third provided unique flavors of milk chocolate, more musk, and marzipan. The marzipan flavor is very distinct, and unfortunately I don\u2019t care for it (forced to eat it as a kid- yuck!).In the last 3rd, honey, vanilla, and musk come back in a strong way for a very last showing before disappearing and leaving with nothing else than a nasty bomb of ashiness and charcoal. At the end, my mouth felt like it was trashed out and nasty, eh.Value :  Did you read what I just wrote above? All that for a whopping $16,\u2026 that is value my friends.Overall Rating :  This cigar performed and tasted worlds apart (better) from the Short Perfecto. If the price tag wasn\u2019t so excessive I would say this was a decent stick. But yet again, I have to say that these cigars are one of the worst values for your hard earned coin. I do get that they market to a different demographic from myself, and that the rich may buy into this marketing ploy. I am otherwise not swayed or swooned by this cigar brand yet and still consider Davidoff just a niche market cigar for those beginner smokers with a lot of money.This post was written by Aaron.

Instead, it sat in my humidor resting nicely and undisturbed except for the regular rotation so I imagined it would be that much better when I finally got around to it.I was finally able to get to it this past weekend.  Unfortunately, I only had one sample so I made sure to sit down and take very detailed notes, not having the luxury of going back to smoke a second one as I usually do to test for consistency or factor whether or not I just got an unlucky sample.  Thanks to the fact that it is a dense, tightly packed cigar, the burn was slow and therefore the total smoking time for this beefy robusto was just under 90 minutes.Appearance :  The Loyal looked slightly rustic with a dark brown Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper with some visible spots of darker reddish brown.  There was visible veining, but tight and compact seams.  The cigar itself had a nice sheen but the wrapper had numerous areas where it was cracked and flaking as shown in the photo.  There was a similar area on the back side.  This was surprising since it came in a cellophane sleeve which leads me to reasonably conclude it must have shipped from the factory that way. The oversized band was nice enough.Construction :  The wrapper held up to my straight cut but too much glue was used on the band causing the wrapper to crack as I struggled to remove the large band, even though I waited until I got close to the band to remove it.Despite the dense and heavy feel to the cigar, I was unhappy to find some hollow areas which points directly at manufacturing and the roller.  I struggled to keep it burning evenly.  The Loyal required numerous touch-ups and one re-light.Flavor :  The cigar had a sweet tobacco and earth aroma and despite being in my humidor for a good period of time, it really didn't acquire many cedar notes. The pre-light draw was good and I got some woody notes, sweet floral notes and natural tobacco.  Aromas were very mild.  I failed to get any meaningful spice to report.  What I did get was akin to extremely mild jalapeno-like heat.The smoke output of the cigar went from good to poor depending on what point I was at the cigar.  The smoke lacked texture.The first third had mild woody and grassy notes with a touch of salt at the front of the palate. There was minimal spice which surprised me given that the filler was a blend of Nicaraguan and Dominican Republic tobacco. The finish was short and again, it consisted mainly of woody and tobacco notes  with only mild spice.The second third didn\u2019t offer up many surprises. The flavor profile for the most part remained the same with the occasional hint of caramel, semi-sweet chocolate and leather notes.  While the flavors were very subtle and almost muted, they did blend together quite well.  I often retro-hale my cigars which usually gets a little more flavor out of them and tells you if there is anything else hiding behind the first wall of flavor.  I was surprised at how easy this cigar retro-haled because there was almost no spice to speak of.  Retro-haling did reveal a little more earthy and wood notes but really did not change the flavor dynamic of this cigar.  The smoke didn\u2019t burn my nose which tells me the Loyal had matured properly and that there was, as I suspected, very little spice to the cigar.The final third offered much of the same.  I did manage to get through some of the hollow areas and when I did the smoke output increased significantly.  However, the smoke was semi sweet and unlike many other creamy cigars sharing the same wrapper, this one left no residue on my palate but thankfully the smoke wasn\u2019t that dry smoke that leaves one parched.  The smoke had hints of sweet, fruity oak to it but the finish was medium and really all flavors diminished quite quickly after exhaling.As I approached the band the Loyal lost much of its sweetness and became mostly earthy, leathery and started to give off dark chocolate-like bitterness.The cigar, in my opinion, was mild-medium bodied and the strength was also mild to medium.  No heavy meal required.  Not once did nicotine become an issue.   Overall the cigar was not very complex, offering the smoker almost 90 minutes of similar flavors with the occasional short lived surprise.  I can\u2019t say the cigar was horrible yet I can\u2019t say it was a standout.  The score reflects my thoughts; it was an average cigar.Value :  The average online price worked out to be $4.90 in my sampling of retailers. I wouldn't pay a penny more than $5.00.

The Tollaficionados are back to review one of the most consistently excellent brands on the market.  Let\u2019s see if this member of its elite family holds true to its siblings standards.  Ladies & Gentlemen, The Montecristo 75th Aniversario.Our good friends at Altadis, USA recently released these celebratory sticks, and Nick, Sr. and I were able to get our hands on a few.  Not an easy get, I assure you!  These babies have been anticipated and talked about for some time now, and to obtain them, especially this early takes connections or a great deal of luck.  The 75th is of limited release, so put your backorder in now so that you can sample a few yourselves.  Now on to the review\u2026Due to the availability of this brand, Nick, Sr. and I sampled different sized sticks.  Sr. with the 6 1/8 x 52 #2, and Jr. with the 5 \u00bd x 52 Edmundo.   Similar in size and experience.At face value these cigars were flawless.  A smooth unblemished wrapper of chocolatey hue and an aroma that whispered premium. (Take that!)  The habano wrapper leaf was stretched smoothly around the rugged binder and a fan fold of Honduran and Nicaraguan long filler in these cigars.  This gem of tobacco goodness could not be mistaken for anything but what it is.  Top shelf.On the light we both agreed, on a medium flavor and perfect draw.  The volume of smoke filled our food holes with thick plumes that swirled out and around the area that we sat, dancing in the mild breeze of a warm spring afternoon.  Both cigars had a solid roll with no soft spots.  A great start with hopes of even greater things to come.These cigars began to build in body at about the two inch point.  Somewhat slower than expected, but the flavor was very pleasant and lingered on the palate.  We agreed that as much as we were enjoying the experience of the 75ths, we were hoping for more to come out of this very special cigar.At the half point, and about 25 minutes into the smoke, the draw, flavor and aroma remained unchanged but absolutely pleasant.  A solid performer to this point, and with the finish approaching, the excitement began to build.  We could no longer contain ourselves, and had to get up and run around in circles in the backyard while never letting the white ash fall from the tip of the Montes.  My Father did a back flip and three tumble saults, while I chose the ever popular jumping jack arm-pit fart combo as my way of releasing the built up excitement created by this cigar.  OK, I\u2019m being silly.  It\u2019s my way.   Back to the review\u2026  :)This cigar was in fact a very satisfying smoke moving into the final third and beginning of its finish.  A subtle sweetness and a touch of spice made it presence known, adding to the experience.  As a matter of fact, after a nice long draw I burped up an orange peel and Dad found himself with a mouthful of caf\u00e9 mocha.  (I couldn\u2019t resist goofing on some of the terms I see being used to explain a cigars taste.  Expect more of this in the future.  I can\u2019t help myself.)Throughout the entire smoke the cigar made its flawless construction known.  No cracking, a perfect draw and no heating up \u2013 even when down to the nub.  This was definitely a cigar that we did not want to put down until we absolutely had to.And the final ranking is\u2026An 8.  We both agreed that with a more potent finish this cigar could have been a 9.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the Montecristo 75th Aniversario series is fantastic!  If you can get your hands on one, you will love it.  But it could have been stellar with a better finish and not just fantastic.  Just Fantastic \u2013 I guess we had very high expectations.Here\u2019s wishing you a long ash!

I took some time off for health reasons, but now I am back and better than ever and ready to start this year off with a review of Inception Cigars from Houston, Texas. Last year, Inception sent over a sampler of their cigars. I smoked through the different sizes and settled on reviewing my favorite of the three sizes, the 6.5 x 46 corona extra.Appearance :  The 518 is six and a half inches of dark, reddish-brown tobacco. I do like how oily the wrapper appears, usually always a good sign. The cigar has very few visible veins and a tight roll with good seams. There is a noticeable bumpiness to the exterior and the cigar does not look as clean and smooth as its large production counterparts in the cigar business. It also sports and solid black, glossy band with red font. The aromas off the wrapper are of earth, dirt, and cedar.Construction :  Even though the 518 has some bumpiness to its exterior, for a small production cigar it seems solidly built. The filler tobaccos are not too packed and let through a good amount of air for a superb draw. The double cap is well placed, although a little off kilter, but it didn\u2019t matter after being lopped off with my Xikar cutter. When squeezing along its lines, there was a minor soft spot near the head of the cigar.Overall burn characteristics showed the 518 performing pretty solid with only a few touch ups needed. No tunneling or canoeing noticed during the smoking experience. Smoke production was thick and copious.Flavor :  After the spark, the Inception 518 shows a lot of dark earthy flavors some slight sweetness backed with a load of spice. After a few puffs, the sweetness seems to take a backseat and the smoke takes on a very dry and chalky texture. The retrohale is taken aback from the drying nature of the smoke. At this point the cigar is over medium bodied and closer the full.After an inch or two the cigar brings forth loads of thick smoke that has some cinnamon spice with some dirtiness that I can only attribute to earthy flavors. Interweaving also are some sweet notes of malt or burnt sugar notes. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a large amount of evolution of the cigar throughout the smoke but it remains enjoyable. The strength seems to smooth out as well, acting more medium+ than full bodied.Closer to the last 2 inches of the smoke, the 518 picks up a little strength that was present in the beginning of the cigar as well as that mouth drying characteristic. But the dryness fortunately didn\u2019t last that long and some full bodied, peppery, and molasses like flavors came to the fray and finished off the cigar.Value :  Although the Inception is a decent cigar, almost $8 puts it into some of the strongest competition in the cigar world.

It\u2019s true that many great cigars have a \u201cbarnyard\u201d aroma, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m thinking of.  I\u2019m talking about pedigree.  And in the case of the La Reloba Sumatra Robusto, the pedigree is very fine indeed.Made in Nicaragua at the My Father cigar factory, the LRSR is the brainchild of Don Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia and his son Jaime.  Over the last decade, Sr. Garcia has built a reputation as one of the world\u2019s greatest cigar makers.  With success after success, the Garcia name has become synonymous with well-crafted, great tasting cigars.  And with the creation of the LRSR, the lineage continues.The LRSR has all the great hallmark Pepin characteristics: a perfect Cuban-style triple cap, great uniformity with no soft spots, and a weighty feeling in the hand.  This looks like a very well constructed cigar.  Add a richly colored Sumatra wrapper and the LRSR looks like a good bet.When presented with the opportunity to try a new Pepin Garcia cigar, my first assumption was that it was going to be a powerhouse.  I mean, his Tatuaje line is super strong with tons of peppery Esteli Ligero, and his own signature black label cigars are intense.  But upon lighting the LRSR I was struck by something unexpected: after a few puffs of the LRSR it was clear that this was actually a very mild cigar.  I welcomed this change.  In the past I have found some of Pepin\u2019s blends to be overly spicy and aggressive.  It was nice to now find a Garcia blend with great balance and a mild temperament.  Going into the stretch, the LRSR was looking good.After an inch or so, the LRSR starts to bloom.  That wonderful Sumatra wrapper brings an almost lemon-like citrus quality.  And with the additional flavors of cedar and sweet coffee, the LRSR has an almost minty brightness.  It\u2019s a buttery smooth smoke that never turns harsh or bitter.  As expected the LRSR burned with perfect uniformity; not one touchup was needed, and the ash simply didn\u2019t want to fall.  I must add, however, that the nub burned hot, precluding me from smoking as much as I would have liked.For a mild cigar, the LRSR is complex enough to keep the smoker interested.  I enjoyed smoking both the samples and could see that for those who thrive on mild cigars, this could be a \u201cbox worthy\u201d stick.  But I tend to rely on my Cigar Memory when judging cigars.   If a cigar is great, I am drawn to it the following day.  Interestingly, the LRSR flavor did not stay with me.  Perhaps if it had been just a touch stronger, with a bit more intensity, I would feel more of an attraction to this otherwise tasty cigar.  But the LRSR has a lot going for it: great construction, nice citrus flavor profile, and a mild character that all cigar smokers could appreciate.  Plus, at  $5/stick, it\u2019s a good everyday cigar.  So although the LRSR won\u2019t win by a length, it still makes a good show of it.Flavors: Lemon, cedar, coffee, mint X Factor: 8.6 Finish: Creamy and clean Strength: Mild-mediumThis post was written by Robustojoe.

Levin teamed up with the Fuentes taking advantage of their manufacturing experience to help him create his cigars. Ashton\u2019s popularity was originally built on its mild, yet flavorful Connecticut Shade wrapped cigars. The popularity of the Ashton brand would explode with the introduction of a powerful full bodied cigar, the Virgin Sun Grown (VSG). In November of 1999 Ashton Cigars unveiled the VSG, the most powerful and full bodied cigar in the Ashton catalog. The VSG sports an Ecuadorian sungrown wrapper. Apparently the VSG, before it was called VSG, was going to have a Chateau de la Fuente wrapper of Opus X fame (Keepers of the Flame, Oct. 1, 2006). But the rarity of the wrapper and the popularity of the Opus killed that plan. That\u2019s how The VSG ended up with the Ecuadorian sungrown wrapper. A few of the VSG vitolas have pretty standard names like Belicoso and Robusto, but others have been given more mystical names like Tres Mystique, Wizard, Echantment, Illusion and Sorcerer. Not sure why that is and unfortunately I was unable to find any info on it.The VSG Sorcerer is a 7.0\u2033 x 49 ring Double Corona. It is wrapped in a beautiful sungrown leaf with tiny veins throughout, sporting an expertly applied cap and a rich tobacco aroma. The cap clipped nicely with my Palio and the foot took a light perfectly. This cigar packs all the power it is hyped to have but even with that power it is surprisingly smooth. The flavors are full bodied yet refined. I\u2019ve heard the VSG referred to as \u201cThe Velvet Hammer\u201d and the name fits. It starts off very rich and smooth with a slightly sweet spice. A fellow BOTL once referred to this flavor as a \u201csungrown twang\u201d. The burn is razor sharp and the ash is well formed but is a little loose and doesn\u2019t hold more than an inch or so. It has a long almost sage like finish that is quite unique and it produces plenty of thick, creamy, off-white smoke. As the smoke progresses the twang lessened and it developed strong notes of earth and leather with an almost floral undertone. I am very impressed with the smooth, refined nature of the flavors given how full and and powerful the cigar is. It packs quite a punch without any harshness or muted flavors you sometime get with strong powerful cigars. In the last third the VSG really picks up with lots of spice and leather with spice on the finish. I smoked it to the nub.A double corona is a long smoke that needs to be above par to be enjoyable otherwise you inevitably get bored with it before you finish it. No chance of boredom here. The VSG Sorcerer is a robust, complex smoke that holds your attention for the entire hour plus it takes to smoke it. It is definitely not a cigar for beginners as the length and power may be too much for someone not used to smoking full bodied cigars. For an experienced cigar smoker it is a real treat and is so good you will want to smoke one more often than just on the special occasions despite its price tag.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

One such cigar that repeatedly tops many lists is the Arturo Fuente Anejo Reserva No. 77.  Resembling a tooth because of its uniquely box pressed torpedo shape, this cigar is more commonly known as the Anejo \u201cShark\u201d. Sought after by both lovers and collectors with fervor similar to the search for Fuente\u2019s Opus X line, this is one cigar that I have been looking forward to trying for some time.As mentioned above, the Shark has a unique obelisk shape that is a result of box pressing the original torpedo.  Carrying a solid heft, the construction of the cigar is excellent.  As this particular smoke was aged since 2006, the oils present on the wrapper\u2019s surface were noticeably transferable to my fingers.  A faint texture of tooth and minor veins gives this smoke a natural appearance without being rugged.  Even the wrapper and foot emit the faint scent of sweet cocoa.Moving into the prelight, my Palio guillotine made a beautiful angled cut and the cigar held up beautifully.  The prelight draw is perfect and the sweetness noted before comes through with a faint tongue tingle of pepper.  A buttery nuttiness comes through as well.  Torching this smoke proves to be a bit of a challenge because of its dense construction.  Once lit, the burn was slightly uneven but that could be because of the issues getting it lit.After a few initial puffs the creamy smoke builds and the nut and sweet flavors develop into more defined almond and perhaps vanilla.  The overall balance is wonderfully deep and substantial but not powerful.  Exhaling through the nose produces a slight tartness that is not unpleasant when accompanied by the sweetness.  It actually reminds me of fresh, uncooked, rhubarb.As the session progresses, the burn remains wavy but controllable.  Additionally, a more prominent Cedar flavor develops.  The overall strength of this cigar builds and eventually tips more towards a spiced profile, although the almond remains.  This lasts for about an inch until the spice tones down and allows the almond, vanilla and Cedar to come back through.  Over the last inch and a half the spice continually builds itself but does not become overbearing.Overall this is a fantastic smoke.  While spicy, every flavor present gets a turn to show its stuff and the overall result is perfect balance and harmony.  On top of that, the construction of the cigar along with its appearance gives it a certain presence.  This is not a cigar that you will forget about when smoking.  One unfortunate drawback of this smoke is its rarity.  Released in limited quantities only around Father\u2019s Day and Christmas a buyer can expect to spend anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars per cigar.  At MSRP I would buy as many as I could find and would be willing to spend a few bucks per stick over that just to ensure I had several on hand. To date, there are only three cigars that I would want to guarantee there was a full box of in my humidor, those being the Fuente Hemingway Short Story, Tatuaje J21 Reserva and now the Fuente Anejo Reserva No. 77 \u201cShark\u201d.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

These cigars are individually placed in a glass tube case and sealed with a wax cap.

Not really mild, it is more of a medium bodied smoke with light yet assertive flavors.  I have been wanting to try the maduro version for a long while and I have finally got around to it.  Sometimes with the sheer volume of different cigars out there it is hard to get to everything you want to try.  Any way, from what I was able to find with some internet searches, it appears the Cabaiguan Maduro isn\u2019t even really a maduro in the traditional sense.  According to Tatuaje\u2019s site and I saw it again on a retailer's site, the wrapper on this cigar is a naturally dark sun grown broadleaf wrapper.  If that sounds familiar to you then you are probably familiar with the La Riqueza line of cigars from Tatuaje.  The wrapper for that cigar is described the exact same way.  So is it the same wrapper?  I have no idea, but I wasn\u2019t able to find a wealth of information on the Cabaiguan maduro and what I did find wasn\u2019t necessarily authoritative.I suppose I could have dropped an email to Havana Cellars and get some details straight from the source but I didn\u2019t.  Looking at the cigar I would guess that this wrapper is related at best but would not guess it is the same as those used on the La Riqueza.  This wrapper is much nicer looking.  The La Riquezas always look rough and lumpy and ugly.  This wrapper has a slight tooth and is generally smoother with an oily sheen.  If it is the same or related, the Cabaiguan got the pick of the litter.  it is still a rustic looking wrapper but it is much prettier than the La Riquezas I have seen.  One other item of note on the dressing if the Cabaiguan Maduro.  It has the same band used on the Cabaiguan Guapos which is a Nicaraguan natural sun grown wrapped cigar of a much lighter shade than these broadleaf maduros.Right off the bat I could tell this isn\u2019t really a Maduro.  Notes of dark chocolate and coffee bean are complimented by a tart sun grown twang that is one of my favorite things about a natural sun grown broadleaf wrapper.  The tartness was the dominate flavor for the entire smoke.  I also picked up notes of cedar and a very subtle sweetness.  Overall not a terribly complex cigar but very robust and enjoyable.  If you are a fan of that sun grown twang then you\u2019ll love this cigar because you get a lot of it.  Although I wouldn\u2019t call this smoke a favorite, I definitely like it for an occasional change of pace especially when I am craving a sun grown.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Sam began a Cain F national tour in March of this year. Among the Cain offerings highlighted in the tour are the unreleased Cain F Nub, a marriage of the construction of the Cain Ligero plus the popular, unique size of the Nub. The \u201cF\u201d stands for fuerte, or strong in Spanish.It\u2019s no secret that I am a fan of Sam Leccia\u2019s work, whether that be on the Nubs or with the Cain cigar line. When I started hearing all the buzz last year about the Cain F, I naturally went to my local B&M\u2019s first to check them out. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t until a few months ago I started seeing these cigars locally. Needless to say, I was happy to get my hands on a few of these for interrogation purposes.Besides a small cuff found in the slightly veiny and oily wrapper, I didn\u2019t find any issues with the appearance or build of the cigar. Also nothing in the way of a scent or aroma of the cigar pre light. Nothing left to do but cut the cigar and get to burning.Giving the cigar a steady burn from wooden matches (mostly because I am out of butane), the Cain F started out with an easy going balanced draw, with slight hints of pepper and spice right at the onset. Those subtle hints of pepper and spice were a nice touch, considering that it was much less than other Nicaraguan cigars that I have smoked in the past. Despite that, this is still a full-bodied smoke, but I think with how Sam blends the tobaccos, he is able to control how much of that kick-to-the-chest ligero flavor will affect someone. Expect that pepper and spice to relax among the flavors after 15 or 20 minutes, leaving you with a smooth, full bodied flavor. As long as you give this cigar plenty of time to burn slowly, it will burn hot and bitter on you.The burn on the Cain F was fine. A couple of minor burn corrections to keep a completely even burn, but nothing that would give pause for consideration. I got both thick smoke and a tight, white ash from the cigar. Both always appreciated in anything that I smoke. While the Cain F didn\u2019t hit me nearly as hard as the Cain Habano, bear in mind that this is still a full-bodied smoke and should have a longer finish on your palette.I recently split a box of these with my best friend, so that should tell you my opinion on them. The Cain F have become my favorite of the Cain line, giving me that full bodied flavor, but much smoother than from the Cain Habano and Maduro lines. If you see these out at your local B&M, do not hesitate to pick these up.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

It seemed though that during the first half of the cigar, it had a light astringency to it; my mouth became slightly dry.  It was not unbearable, but it was unexpected.  The retrohale felt peppery just like white pepper. About an inch into it, nutty flavors became more dominant while the pepper disappeared.  The rest of the cigar featured nuts as the predominant flavor.", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/punch-uppercut.jpg?iv=16"}, "punch champion": {"origin": "Origin : Honduras Format : Perfecto Size : 4 1/2 x 60 (at the thickest point) Ring : 30 (foot) to 60 (thickest point) Wrapper : Ecuadoran Sumatra Binder : Connecticut Broadleaf Filler : Honduran, Nicaraguan, Dominican (Piloto Cubano) Factory : Honduras American Tabaco S.

Thank you, Stephen!This is a review of just one cigar. It was given to me as a gift from Ted the owner of Big Jack's Cigars in Boothbay Harbor, ME. I always stop by there to say hi when I am in Boothbay Harbor and I recommend you do too. There is no lounge or anything. Just Ted who is passionate about his cigars and he carries some nice bottles of wine as well.Ted told me Punch created this cigar to be a competitor to the Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story. It is a member of the \u201coriginal\u201d Honduran Punch Family with an Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper, a Connecticut binder, and filler tobaccos from Honduras.It's been resting in my humidor for about a month.Appearance :  This odd looking perfecto, which resembles a bowling pin, is 4 \u00bd and 30 ring at the foot and 60 at its widest point.

To this point my only experience with Graycliff was with their Double Espresso, which I had enjoyed at the time.  Outside of that, I had not read or heard much about them either.  Some brief research into the brand showed that the Graycliff runs a resort, restaurant, cigar company combination out of Nassau in the Bahamas.

Well keep thinking.  We have a special guest reviewer assisting me on laying forth the positives and negatives this time around.  Uncle Bill from Ohio came into town to sit in on a session of tobacco worship, and give his opinions on the My Father Le Bijou 1922.Being that Nick Sr. was not available to take part in this review (don\u2019t worry, he will be back for the next go-around), Uncle Bill and I decided that we would use this opportunity to review a cigar created as a tribute to Fatherhood.  Jamie Garcia created this stick consisting of an Ecuadorian grown Habano Oscuro wrapper concealing a blend of Nicaraguan long filler as a \u201ctip of the hat\u201d to his Father Don Pepin Garcia.  And we smoke them in honor of our Poppas.  My Dad Nick Sr. and Uncle Bill\u2019s Dad Karl (My Grandfather).We chose to enjoy the toro.  An $11, 6 x 52 beauty from the My Father stable.  The Le Bijou is actually the second created in this line of 3, (The My Father, Le Bijou and The Limited Edition) and it has turned out to be the best.  But we will get to that soon enough.Uncle Bill rolled into town from Ohio on a beautiful Wednesday afternoon and came over to check out my new house and enjoy a fine smoke.  Yes, I just recently joined the American homeowners club after years of stuffing the pockets of others for the privilege of residing between their walls.  But I write this sitting in my own house, and even better, from within my own cigar lounge that my wife has allowed me to possess.  Let the doves fly, sound the trumpets, release the Kracken (zipper is stuck, can\u2019t right now) because I pay a mortgage therefore I am.OK, cigars, that\u2019s why you are here.  We unwrapped these beauties and toasted the foot releasing a sweet aroma.  A sign of things to come.  Uncle Bill puffed his toro to a glow and sat back enjoying the burst of flavor that the My Father produced immediately.  To his surprise, being one who tends to lean towards a mild cigar, this full bodied stick tickled his fancy.  And Uncle Bill has an ample fancy.  He is a big guy!As the cigar progressed, approaching the half-way point, its profile grew to not only continue the sweet character we had been enjoying, but began to add a peppery quality as well.  Not overpowering by any means.  Just enough to add a little depth to an already enjoyable smoking experience.The full moon began to rise over the pines as we discussed not only the enjoyment in partaking of the Le Bijou, but the great time that we were having just sitting there spending some Uncle/Nephew time together.  It happens all too infrequently, but we made the most of it.  The My Father Le Bijou 1922 just made it that much better.Construction was flawless.  A durable wrapper, an even burn and no plugs to hinder the ease of the draw made this a 5 star smoke.  Volumes of smoke cascaded from the tip filling the air with a grand scent.  A pleasure to the snotholes, no doubt.Come the end of the cigar, the all around positive experience was solidified.  The only thing harder than having to put this cigar out was saying goodbye to Uncle Bill.  But with a twinkle in his eye and a hardy ho, ho, ho he said that he would be back on Christmas Day.  See you soon Uncle Bill.Coming soon \u2013 Nick, Sr. gets back in the lounge chair and we enjoy a private label that we are sure you will want to get your hands on.Here\u2019s wishing you a long ash!

He is tops in my book. A friend gifted me one of these early this year and I have been stocking them ever since. Incredibly, an online vendor ran a special in mid-November for a Padilla sampler where I was able to pick these up for $3.55 a stick (including shipping). An absolutely absurd price considering MSRP is now $12 US! Couldn't pass it up.Evidently Ernesto Padilla can't get enough of these either. I read a funny story about Ernesto's visits to El Rey de los Habanos in Little Havana. Pepin claims they must watch him carefully when he comes to review operations. He is known to snatch up too many cigars from the rolling tables and \"smoke the profits\" as Pepin tells it. Ernesto is just a cigar lover like you and me. Who can blame him! More on Ernesto and his background can be found in an interview with Doc @ Stogie Fresh.Introduced in 2006, the Padilla Signature 1932 is a Nicaraguan puro named in tribute to Ernesto's father, the late Heberto Padilla, noted Cuban poet and friend of Ernest Hemingway, who was born in the year 1932. During October 2006 the Robusto, Churchill and Torpedo vitolas were released followed in January 2007 by the Toro. The Lancero, sporting a pigtail cap, was released in February 2007 and the La Perla in late March/early April. The wrapper is a specially fermented and aged (5 years) Cuban-seed Nicaraguan Corojo using Pepin's proprietary family process. Due to the rarity of the wrapper, the production of this cigar is very limited making it a challenge to find.Appearance :  A stunning cigar wrapped in a dark Corojo with a nice satin-like sheen and a very small tooth evident over the entire wrap.

However, I\u2019m back and have lots of great cigar reviews to post.The Padr\u00f3n 3000 Maduro.  I have to be honest in saying that this is one of my favorite cigars.  I always keep them stocked in my humidor and when I\u2019m running low I just order another box. The Padr\u00f3n 3000 Series, natural and maduro, are available in boxes of 26, box of 4, and single cigars.  It is definitely not the most attractive cigar or the most complex by any means however for me it provides what a cigar should and is the most practical without burning a hole in the wallet.  I personally enjoy this cigar at cookouts, barbeques and the occasional Par 3 golf course.Anyhow, before we light up let's talk about Padr\u00f3n Cigars Inc.  The following information was found at the Padr\u00f3n  website:\u201cThe Padr\u00f3n name is not only the brand name it is the family name. It is family honor and tradition that are the foundation upon which Padr\u00f3n Cigars has been built.  The Padr\u00f3n  family has been involved in the tobacco industry since the late 1800\u2019s. Damaso Padr\u00f3n, the family patriarch, was born in the Canary Islands and later immigrated to Pinar del Rio, the richest tobacco-growing region of Cuba. There, along with Francisco and his other sons, he began working in the tobacco industry and developed the commitment of producing the best tobacco he possibly could. This commitment of producing the best tobacco is a tradition that has been passed down from one generation of Padr\u00f3n to the next and is the backbone of what Padr\u00f3n Cigars is today.  Padr\u00f3n Cigars now has over 600 employees working in factories in Nicaragua, Honduras and the corporate headquarters, which are still in the same locale of Little Havana where it all started in 1964. Padr\u00f3n Cigars is still a wholly owned family business working under Jos\u00e9 Orlando Padr\u00f3n\u2019s leadership to continue the family legacy.\u201dMore information on the family, cigars, plus great pictures can be found at http://www.padron.com.Like I stated earlier, the wrapper on this cigar may not be the most appealing to the eye.  This dark box pressed puro presents a veiny, rough looking wrapper leaf.  The cap of the cigar is disheartening being put on very sloppy, showing loose leaf parts.  Pre-light smell contains a heavy chocolate scent with notes of earthy goodness and the pre-light draw is loose and promising.The Padr\u00f3n 3000 Maduro immediately produced lots of creamy smoke under a loose but not too loose draw.  I personally prefer the looser draw.  To me smoking a cigar is a relaxing luxury not a hard working job.  After smoking the first quarter of the 3000 maduro, the cigar showed notes of a coco sweetness.The ash was a silky gray/white and fell off once getting past the running point.  The burn throughout was a little uneven however the cigar fixed itself each time.  Halfway through the cigar continued to be sweet but the coco turned into an earthy, nutty flavor.The finish on the cigar was a little more harsh than I expected showing hints of spice and pepper with a toasty aroma.  Again, this cigar is one of my personal favorites and it smokes/performs much better than it looks (remember\u2026 looks can be deceiving).In closing this review I\u2019ll credit my Thanksgiving after meal smoke to what led me to do a review of this cigar.  Most of the time I\u2019ll pull out a special smoke I\u2019ve been saving or aging for those special occasions however something told me to go with the Padr\u00f3n 3000 Maduro after this year's dinner\u2026 GREAT choice.

Overall it was a very relaxing and rejuvenating experience.  During a couple of the nights, my father and I made our way over to Sosa Cigars in Downtown Disney.  The people at the cigar bar were more than happy to allow us to supply our own cigars with the purchase of a drink, which I found more than reasonable.  After ordering a Jameson, I set upon a cigar I had wanted to try out for some time; the Coronado Toro by La Flor Dominicana.The LFD Coronado has a Nicaraguan sun-grown wrapper.  With evident oils and minimal veins it presents a very striking image. A primarily gold band compliments the hue of the wrapper and the crowned cat (cheetah?) makes for interesting conversation.  A filler stuffed with a blend of Dominican Sumatra and Piloto Cubano along with the Dominican Corojo binder makes for a very firm cigar.  Everything appears structurally sound with all seams and the cap resting securely in place.Eager to get this one burning, it lights without fail.  Initial flavours of earth, grass and hay reveal themselves.  There is also a slight sweetness that lingers on the tongue.  Shortly into the cigar pepper adds itself into the mix.  As the cigar progresses, the flavour profile remains very consistent.  The only exception is that the further into the stick you get, the more leather, earth and tobacco replace the original grass and hay.  While not offering up any surprises, the balance of the Coronado is fantastic; truly enjoyable.Construction on this cigar is pretty solid as well.  There are a couple of cases where the burn runs a bit and requires minor touchups but for the majority of the stick it is spot on.  The ash is very solid and holds for a minimum of an inch and a half at a time.Overall, this was a really enjoyable smoke.  It does not offer a significant amount of complexity but that is not bad here.  During the last two inches of this smoke I found it turned quite bitter and ended up letting the cigar extinguish itself earlier than planned. Despite this, the flavours during the rest of the cigar are balanced and enjoyable.   Retailing for about $7.50 I would suggest trying this one.  I am certainly going to keep my eyes open and given the opportunity, will try another one to see if the bitterness is only found in this specific sample.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

The smoke never becomes bitter, it is round, and thick delivers plenty of flavor with each draw. The only drawback is that there isn\u2019t much evolution of flavor from start to finish, but that is okay with me you never want the flavors in this stick to change.

The 3 (Tres) Siglos line was first introduced in 2006 and is reputed to be a complex, full-bodied, spicy addition to the Gran Habano family of cigars. The key aspect of this blend is the use of three different types of ligero tobacco in the filler. This cigar features ligero from Nicaraguan, Costa Rican, and Colombian tobacco. I am making the assumption that this is why the number \u201c3\u2033 is used int he name of the cigar so it got me curios about the word \u201cSiglos\u201d. I never had given any thought to that word until now and I discovered that siglo is the Spanish word for century. So that makes the name of this cigar (translated by me) \u201cthree centuries\u201d. I\u2019m not sure if there is any significance there. The company was founded in 1995 so it certainly isn\u2019t three hundred years old. It may not have any significance at all, or it refers to something I was not able to ascertain. Really, I guess it is all irrelevant since what is important here is this question \u2013 \u201cIs the cigar any good?\u201d Well, let's find out\u2026The shade-grown wrapper on this cigar is a very nice rosado in color.  It is a little veiny with an oily sheen to it and has a neatly applied cap.  The 3 Siglos seems to be well filled and very well put together.  It sports two elegant white bands trimmed in gold leaf making for a very a handsome and elegant presentation. The smoke starts out very smooth and creamy with a hint of vanilla and very little spice on the finish. The first third of this cigar had me wondering if this really was all ligero in the filler. As I moved into the second third I was still asking myself that same question. The flavors were excellent with notes of creamy toasted nuts and a little bit of a musty earthiness, but still very little spice and none of the pepper I\u2019d expect from a cigar with a lot of ligero. At this point I\u2019d describe the cigar as a mildly complex and very enjoyable medium-bodied smoke. It burned slow and cool. The ash was a bit flaky, dark grey and black with swirls of brown in it. Things finally began to pickup a little bit in the last third with addition of more black pepper notes and a little more robust profile.Overall this was a really enjoyable smoke with excellent flavors.  Based on its makeup I was expecting it to be a fuller smoke than it turned out to be.  I think maybe the shade grown wrapper contributed to toning it down a bit.  Even though it wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, it was still a very good cigar and I recommend giving it a try.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

After seeing the discontinued M-7 boxes lying about the factory floor, Dion Giolito decided to put them to use in making a cigar with balance and elegance.  By perfectly blending Nicaraguan Criollo and Corojo tobaccos and topping it with a Rosado wrapper Dion was able to create this newest member of the Epernay portfolio.On to the review\u2026The pre-light on my Illusione Le Matin showed a veiny, box pressed, dark chocolate wrapper.  I found a couple of spotty watermarks on the wrapper and upon inspection the foot showed a loose roll.  Cap was a very nice triple seam and the band a simplistic white with gold writing.  Cold smell is a woody, sweet, hay.  Cold draw was easy and loose with notes of spice, cream, and wood.The Le Matin opened with a full bodied load of rich creamy smoke.  Excellent!  Lots of spice, wood, and cream covered my palate in the initial tasting notes.  Draw was absolutely effortless and the burn a tad wavy (had to eventually be corrected).  Ash was a very brittle dark gray and fell off after the first inch or so.  Aroma only backed up the creamy barnyard tastes.Immediately into the second third the cigar turned sweet with a velvety truffle taste/sweet cream.  Amazing and most enjoyable!  The back palate showed more dark toasted tastes and again the burn had to be touched up.  Aroma and ash remained the same as noted in the first third.In the final third of my Illusione Epernay Le Matin I was embraced with tasting notes of meaty, nutty, dark oak wood chips.  Burn only got worse and had to again be touched up.  Supposedly being the more medium bodied line of Illusione cigars I found the opposite of my Le Matin.  I would classify this smoking experience as full-bodied throughout.So, final thoughts over the Illusione Epernay Le Matin are mixed but run more on the good side than bad.  Even though the aesthetics and taste profile of the cigar were close to perfect the performance flat out sucked.  The burn and draw of the cigar just completely lowered the overall enjoyment of the smoke.  If these two things could be corrected (draw a touch tighter; burn even and consistent) this cigar would easily fall into the 28 \u2013 30 range on my rating scale.  Overall though, the enjoyment factor is there so go pick a couple up and see what you think.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 6 pts. Overall Experience: 8 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

I\u2019ve been through some important changes in my life (new job, new home, new city\u2026) which barely allowed enough time to take care of the website. I would like to thank all the reviewers for bringing you fresh content every week. During the last months I\u2019ve been mostly smoking cigars for pleasure, relaxing with a glass of cognac after a long day. I didn\u2019t feel like reviewing a Petit Edmundo again, or a Party Short. Last week, however, I did some on- and off-line shopping and also received a little package from Cayman islands (more on that in one of the next reviews), so I\u2019ve got some interesting experiences to share with you.We\u2019ll start with a Tatuaje J21 Reserva. This is the very first Tatuaje that I tried (can you believe that?) and I was really curious to see whether it would live up to its reputation (you can check Joe\u2019s review for example).Appearance :  Two cigars were smoked for this review and they had similar characteristics both in terms of construction and flavor. The appearance of these Nicaraguan puros is awesome. The corojo wrapper is fairly dark, with a couple of large veins running along the cigar. The triple cap is just beautiful. Firm to the touch, it feels very good in hand.Construction :  Although the pre-draw seemed loose to me, the draw has been fine throughout the smoking experience. J21 Reserva produced clouds of ample white smoke which looked great. My only complaint here is the burn, which required a correction every inch or so. I noticed this issue with both cigars that I smoked.Flavor :  Pre-light, the wrapper had a distinct honey smell, quite surprising as I was expecting something really peppery. That\u2019s what I was thinking as I lit the cigar with my Z-plus. Well, the pepper didn\u2019t wait any longer and made its appearance in a strong kick, which was very similar to the way a lot of Cuban cigars behave during the first minutes. In the first third, main flavors are black pepper and wood. As expected, the pepper progressively reduced its presence and I was mostly dealing with a mix of woody and earthy flavors, completed by some bitter chocolate. The bouquet was rather complex with many notes that I couldn\u2019t put a label on. What I definitely felt though was the fact that the cigar was slowly building power. Medium-bodied at the half mark, it became quite powerful in the last third and required more time between puffs, without being bitter. A great complex smoke overall.Value :  I paid slightly more than the average retail price (these can be found at $10-11 each).

A small company named Tobacos Mata Fina is aiming to change this trend with its Monte Pascoal line. Translated into English, Monte Pascoal means Easter Mountain. The company has a manufacturing workforce of 25 employees which allows an annual production of approximately 500,000 units. Tobacos Mata Fina blends each of the six vitolas in the Monte Pascoal line with a different ratio of Mata Fina and Mata Norde, creating stark differences in flavor between sizes. If that isn\u2019t unique enough each box of cigars is stamped with two dates; the date the cigars were rolled and the date they were boxed.The Monte Pascoal Corona has a dark brown wrapper that is very dry in appearance with a sweet tobacco aroma. It is well rolled and is very uniform in both geometry and density. The band has a colorful image of the company logo with gold coins on either side.The Mata Fina leaf lends a very sweet character to the smoke but never becomes cloying. Flavors of spice and nuts dominate through a background of earth and wood. The moderate finish is sweet and earthy, alluding to a faint presence of chocolate. The Monte Pascoal maintains a medium body and strength throughout.The little-known corona burns for an hour before becoming warm and furnishes the smoker with a trouble free, relaxing experience. I would reach for this cigar again when I crave something unique. It\u2019s a shame Brazilian tobacco is not more widely utilized as it is very unique and has quite a bit to offer even the most jaded palates.Appearance/Structure \u2013 12/15 Smoking Characteristics \u2013 23/25 Flavor \u2013 21/25 Overall Impression \u2013 33/35Total - 89This post was written by Nathan.

This torpedo had a good draw; however, it burned unevenly initially. The ash that it produced was tight although flaky in some spots. The cigar also developed a tunnel which caused a flame-out after the ash was tapped.Flavor :  The initial aroma of the wrapper was that of mint with hints of barnyard and earthy notes. The foot had more of roasted coffee and chocolate aromas. The pre-light draw had a definite chocolate taste; the cigar was very spicy and peppery to the tongue.One gets good flavors like nutmeg, vanilla, and coffee immediately after lighting the stick. The second third of the cigar was more leathery while the vanilla disappeared; a fruity taste seemed to accompany the leather flavor. The last third featured all leather flavor.The finish was long with notes of leather throughout the smoke.Value :  At about $6.00/stick, I would not consider this a bad price for these cigars. However, you may be disappointed if you are looking for a strong smoke; I found the Green Label to be more of a medium-strength cigar.Overall Rating :  I enjoyed the flavor profile of the Panacea Green Label Torpedo; it complemented the cup of coffee I had as a beverage during the smoke. I did have burn issues with the cigar, so it was not a perfect smoking experience. I would encourage all smokers to try a Pennsylvania Broadleaf-wrapped cigar. Maybe a fun exercise would be to take a one of these and compare it to a Connecticut Broadleaf wrapped-cigar (grown in the US).

Such was the case with the Aging Room Small Batch M356 cigar.Being a fan of the \u201cold school\u201d robusto size, I chose to sample the Rondo vitola (5\u00d750).[i] I figured the cigar would be strong as ALL Cigar Aficionado ratings are skewed that way, yet I was not prepared for what the M356 had in store.  But first the usual review stuff:The M356 Rondo is a perfectly constructed cigar.  No soft spots, nice weight in the hand, and a perfect draw.  The cap is tightly wound and keeps its shape long after the guillotine cut.  Its burn is as good as it gets, with an ash that just doesn\u2019t want to drop.  I\u2019ve never smoked a cigar with a better burn.Color-wise, the M356 is unique.  It\u2019s a Colorado-Claro with an almost rust color wrapper, and its mottled appearance makes for an unusual presentation.  I\u2019ve never before seen a cigar with this coloration.  Now down to what\u2019s most important, its flavor:At the very first puff, the M356 really grabs your attention.  It produces an almost effervescent sensation on the tongue, unlike anything I\u2019ve ever tasted.  Some may describe this as spicy, but it\u2019s not the typical tobacco spice.  It\u2019s more of a feeling not unlike a carbonated beverage.  No, the cigar doesn\u2019t taste like soda, but it has an almost bubbly intensity.  But what impresses me the most is a taste I can only describe as \u201cbright\u201d.  In a world where dark cigars have gained prominence, the M356 comes across as a beacon of light.  There\u2019s no earth or espresso tones in this stick, but rather aromatic flavors of wood and spearmint.  Smoking it is a stimulating experience, one that begs you to keep smoking.  So much so that the M356 has been the only cigar I\u2019ve smoked all week.The history behind the M356 is intriguing.  Originally designed as a member of the Swag line, the outstanding tobaccos used in this stick were of insufficient supply for a general release cigar.  As a result the line was classified as Small Batch and only a limited number of boxes were produced.  Rafael Nodal, the creator of Oliveros Cigars explains the process here.The Aging Room Small Batch M356 is the first truly outstanding cigar I\u2019ve smoked in a long time.  I was starting to get bored by all the maduros that have recently flooded the market.  To find something with such a unique character has re-kindled my love of cigars.  But with uniqueness comes polarization.  If dark, earthy cigars are your thing, the M356 may not be appealing.  For me, uniqueness is what I look for in a cigar, and this stick has it in spades.  So love it or hate it, one thing is for sure, the M356 has a point of view, and I love what it has to say.Happy smokes, JoeFlavors: Wood, Spearmint, \u201cbright\u201d tobacco X Factor: 9.4 Finish: Creamy Strength: Strong[i] I say \u201cold school\u201d because the robusto ring size has gotten fatter over the last few years.

The draw was easy with just enough resistance but felt a tad more open near the end.  You can see why I made the deductions in the photos. Flavor :  Lighting this cigar greets you with some mild pepper and very noticeable woodsy and earthy nuttiness.Most of the first third was one dimensional, not much change in flavor but the flavors were for the most part enjoyable.  There were some infrequent bursts of unsweetened coffee and toasted nuts with predominantly earthy undertone.  The smoke output was exceptional at the start.  A nice thick white cloud after every puff. The finish was medium in duration and pleasant, with just a lingering hint of mild spice. The strength was mild to medium.I noted some pleasant sweetness enter the profile as I started the second third and the cigar left a nice touch of salt on the lips. There were some very mild hints of citrus, dried fruits and semi-sweet chocolate. The pepper was still there but remained mild and actually decreased from the first third. There was a decent balance between semi-sweet cocoa-bitter dark chocolate with very slight peppery finish.  Again, aside from the hints of the aforementioned flavors, the cigar remained primarily earthy and woodsy although the wood notes were a tad sweeter.Approaching the halfway point offered much of the same for flavor, smoke output and burn. At this point the cigar needed its first minor touch-up as the burn wavered. I did pick up a few more intense bursts of roasted nuts, unsweetened coffee and dark chocolate with the latter offering the occasional bitterness. There was a minor increase in the amount of spice but the overall spicy remained subdued. The finish was short to medium and offered some very mild hints of citrus and sweet woodsy tones.The brownish ash held firm and there was no flaking. The draw remained good. As the cigar approached the halfway mark some strength started to come through making it more medium in strength. Overall though, I would still consider this stick a mild-medium strength cigar with the nicotine noticeable but not problematic.  A good cigar for those looking for a milder smoke.  At the halfway point I also noted some pleasant sweetness to the smoke\u2019s texture, with the smoke leaving a nice sweet residue on the palette.There was only one more burn issue to report beyond the halfway mark when the cigar needed another minor touch-up.  I did find that the cigar started to get \u201cdryer\u201d after the second half.  The pepper notes were pretty much gone only to come back on occasion the rest of the way, albeit very mild. The primary flavors remained woodsy, earthy but accompanied by occasional hints of leather and roasted nuts. The smoke remained thick but as I approached the final third the sweetness noted earlier had left the smoke and it became dry on the palate. More earthy notes were picked up on the front of my palate with some nuttiness at the back end. It still remained woodsy and earthy but did surprise with the occasional burst of dried fruit and sweetness.   Some bitterness started to make its way into the profile as I approached the final third.As I started that final third of the cigar I picked up a very pleasant albeit brief sweetness at the front of the palate, resembling some semi-sweet chocolate/caramel but  unfortunately this didn\u2019t last long (I wish it did because the remainder of the smoke started to get more bitter). By the time I removed the band, the smoke lost most of its flavor and while there were infrequent notes of toasted caramel and nuts, the rest of the cigar remained on the bitter earthy side.Value :  This smoke can be had for between $4.75 to $5.25 depending on where you look and perhaps even a tad lower if you buy by the box.  Considering some of the price increases we are seeing lately for more popular cigars in this vitola, this cigar is considered great value.

They are also great for the golf course or as a daily smoke given their attractive price point.If it is significant complexity or \u2018strength\u2019 you are after then you will be disappointed. However, for a medium strength/medium bodied cigar it wasn\u2019t bad at all.  Most of the flavors that greet you on lighting the Osa Sol stay with you the rest of the way in varying degrees of intensity with the occasional hints of varying sweetness.  While it is mainly a woodsy and earthy smoke, there were some satisfying areas of sweetness, dried fruit, toasted caramel and nuttiness to the flavor profile along with the occasional hint of mild citrus.  The cigar gets bitter fast near the band and that bitterness never leaves so keep that in mind when smoking yours. Best to put it out as soon as that bitterness appears so as not to ruin the experience. To that end, it is not a cigar I would nub.  It is definitely worth a try.There weren\u2019t enough lasting changes in the flavor profile to classify this as an overly complex smoke. Instead, it remained one dimensional most of the way.  One dimensional cigars are not necessarily a bad thing so long as the flavors are pleasing.

Its arrival was preceded by a lot of hype and buzz brought about by two unique features of the cigar.  Number one, the wrapper caused a good deal of buzz.  The CAO America sports two wrappers, both American grown.  It has a Connecticut grown broadleaf maduro wrapper and a Connecticut shade grown wrapper.  They are applied to the cigar in a manner that creates a unique pin striping effect.  Another feature of the cigar that generated a good deal of chatter was the four country blend of 100% Ligero filler.  This was reported to be one of the strongest most full-bodied cigars in the CAO portfolio.Available in six sizes, every one of them boasting a girthy ring gauge of 50 or above:It takes a lot of tobacco to fill a cigar with a 50 ring gauge, and even more for a cigar with a 56 ring.  When the filler is supposed to be 100% ligero, it is only natural that you expect that cigar to be powerful beast of a smoke.  However, the reputation of the CAO America has preceded its arrival in my humidor and I am well aware of the many reports that this cigar falls well short of the hype and apparently it is not nearly as full bodied as CAO would have us all believe.  That said, I like to judge these things for myself so I am trying to approach this smoke with an open mind\u2026As a loudly proclaimed lover of Lonsdales and Coronas it will come as no surprise that I am bothered by the awkwardness of the large ring gauge of the Potomac.  I feel like I have a big jawbreaker candy in my mouth when smoking it.  The flavors start off smooth.  Strong notes of Leather and damp earth dominate the beginning of the smoke.  It starts off medium in body and mild in strength with no real threat of being any fuller.  The flavors are decent though muddled at times and they never really change.  Lots of leather and earth and some occasional creamy notes.  The burn was impressive.  With the two different wrappers I expected it to run a little uneven at the least but it stayed very straight burning perfectly the whole time.  The ash was white and perfectly formed.  It holds on tight and needs to be tapped off. Overall I\u2019d say the CAO America is a good smoke, but not a great one.  The ring gauge is a problem for me.  I really dislike the girth of it.  It was very uncomfortable to smoke.  I\u2019d probably have less of a problem with one of the 50 ring vitolas.  It is a bit one dimensional, but the flavors are enjoyable.  The construction is impeccable.  This is supposed to be CAO\u2019s most robust offering but I found the CAO Anniversary Maduro to be more full bodied than this cigar.  The America really is a Medium bodied smoke never really approaching anything I\u2019d considered full bodied.  from that standpoint it is a bit of a disappointment, but putting that aside it is a nice cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Bailey Company. I had the pleasure of discussing with Andrew Roth about this release. Speaking with him it becomes immediately apparent that he and his family are passionate about fine cigars, and they are equally excited about this first release. Andrew\u2019s enthusiasm is contagious!Founded in 1932 by Raymond Roth as a humble retail cigar store, Raymond built his business into the legacy it is today, the leading wholesale cigar distributor in the United States. Their motto: \u201cSupermarket to the Industry\u201d.  Raymond passed away in 1998, and his family felt it only appropriate to develop a tribute in his honor. The result is Don Ramon. As Andrew put it \u201cThese just simply had to be right\u201d. And I am delighted to say, they are!Manufactured at the Camacho factory in Honduras this premium offering possesses some of the finest construction I\u2019ve seen, with a flavor profile to match. Available in 2 blends across 4 of the most popular formats, they are packaged in beautiful Cabinets of 25.Appearance :  The Connecticut is a beautiful toothy wrapper with impossibly fine veins, having the color of fine grained tan leather, it is stunning. The band is quite elegant and regal. The Maduro wrapper has equally amazing quantities of tooth, with a beautiful dark chocolate color.\u00a0 Construction :  The cigars are firm with no soft spots, and are quite smooth. Band is easily removed with no danger of impacting the wrapper. It possesses an effortless draw, that generates significant amounts of pleasant white gray smoke, leaving behind a stunning white, firm and tightly formed ash that holds firm to the body.  I find the ash columns to be quite content to remain intact for nearly 3 full inches before release. Burn is amazingly precise, requiring no management. My only criticism being that with such a generous draw my tendency is to hurry just a bit. The consequence being that the cigar does heat up a little on the finish. This is a very minor issue that is mainly my responsibility any way.Flavor :  The Connecticut upon prelight is musty with a sweet grassy note. Very balanced in the first and second thirds, it is woody with flavors of cedar, new leather and a subtle mint spice on the first palette, a roasted coffee bean flavor with a slight vegetal note on the second palette. Throughout the experience there is a subtle sweet undertone. In the final third there is an increase in the power of the profile, not overbearing or brutish mind you, just a noticeable power increase in the profile. This is also where I found the most evolution to this cigar. There is a shift to a rather bright red chili flavor with notes of cedar and leather. The finish is bright and tangy with subtle notes of nutmeg and cinnamon, a very satisfying cigar.The Maduro pre-light is of molasses and aged tobacco. The first third is a lovely Maduro sweet flavor with notes of cocoa intertwined with delicate vanilla and cedar. It provides a Port Wine flavor on the second palette, truly a delight. Closing the first third a subtle note of fennel is introduced, as such it undertakes a supporting role. The second third presents a smooth, pleasant but dramatic transition to a spice dominated profile with flavors of black pepper, red chili and leather. The final third and finish develops into a crescendo that is quite bright, spicy and tangy, medium to medium full bodied it is quite a bold statement that closes this experience out.Value :  The price point on these cigars is well within line considering their overall quality and performance. Given their presence nationally, one could draw the conclusion that these cigars will be readily available.Overall Rating :  The fact that these tobaccos are from a world renowned region, as well as the brightness in the finish, I think that 1-2 years age on these has the potential to set the stage for an epic experience. I find myself enjoying these in my regular rotation now. The Connecticut is welcome company to the morning coffee and subsequent commute. The Maduro pairs exceptionally well with an evening Single-malt or Port.This brand in its current incarnation is unquestionably worthy of a place in the world of premium cigars. These cigars achieve the highest standards in terms of quality and flavor. I give these a Recommended Buy rating.

He intended the cigars to be unique gifts given to customers of his family\u2019s watch business. Twenty-three years later, this growing boutique brand produces over two dozen distinct blends and recently released a new line called the Cellar Reserve.The name and packaging of the Cellar Reserve Churchill elicits vivid imagery of rolling green hillsides marked with crisp rows of grape vines bursting through the earth and perhaps even gracefully shimmering in a gentle summer breeze. Despite outward appearances the contents of this box did not originate from the gravelly soil of a renowned French chateau. In fact, it is an obscure pairing of tobacco from disparate farms isolated geographically by miles of ocean that gave birth to the Gurkha Cellar Reserve Prisoner Churchill. The oily Criollo wrapper is mottled with a few medium sized veins but rolled nicely with tight seams. A grandiose band holds an overwhelming amount of unnecessary text but is easy to remove.The cigar begins softly with a mild vegetal note accompanied by an underlying sweetness. As the cigar warms the texture becomes creamy with smooth medium bodied flavors of earth, nuts, and wood overtaking the initial mild flavors. The nutty finish gives a lingering effect but is moderate in length. A slightly firm draw toward the beginning relaxes a few inches in.The Cellar Reserve is a relaxing cigar that won\u2019t smother the palate in dense flavors but still leaves the smoker satisfied. Lasting for slightly over an hour and a half, the cigar retains balance throughout almost the entire duration and does not become warm until the last inch. I would like to thank Gurkha for supplying the cigar for review.Appearance/Structure \u2013 12/15 Smoking Characteristics \u2013 23/25 Flavor \u2013 21/25 Overall Impression \u2013 32/35Total - 88This post was written by Nathan.

Billed as a bolder, more full-bodied blend their website tells us we can expect all the great flavors of the Panacea Black Maduro only in a fuller, stronger experience. Read about my experience with the Black Maduro here, and if you are unfamiliar with the Flatbed Cigar Company and Panacea cigars, check out my review of the Panacea Black Natural here.  The Red changes things up a bit with the introduction of a Habano binder and plenty of Ligero tobacco.  The wrapper is the same dark Brazilian Maduro that is used on the Panacea Black Maduro.  The 560 is a big beefy cigar and the guys at Flatbed decided it needed its own band that is more appropriate for a cigar of this girth, \u201cWe also gave it a different style Black Label band better suited for a big-ole cigar.\u201dNow it is no secret I think a 60 ring gauge is just too damn big.  I don\u2019t like it.  I find cigars this large awkward and uncomfortable to smoke.  At 5\u201911\u2033 and 225 lbs (the gym is paying off, I\u2019m smaller than I used to be, but yet), I\u2019m not a small guy.  I just think a 60 ring is excessive.  I also have found in my own experience that cigars often lose something when they are made this big.  Flavors become muddled, the subtleties of a blend get lost in the massive amounts of filler it takes to make a cigar this large.  I also acknowledge though that there are some examples of blends that just \u201cwork\u201d in these larger formats.  I hope the Panacea Red is one of those blends, but we\u2019ll see.  Regardless I think I may order myself a sampler of the reds in one of the more standard sizes to see what I think of the blend regardless of what my opinion turns out to be of this particular vitola.The Panacea Red 560 has a noticeably \u201clight\u201d dark brown wrapper for a Maduro, especially for a Brazilian maduro.  It has a handful of small veins running across its surface.  The draw is excellent but predictably the ring gauge is a bit awkward.  It starts off very light and almost mild but quickly bolsters.  The flavors were medium-full with a light to medium strength.  It is a very well-balanced cigar with creamy notes of toasted wood and a hint of sweetness complimented nicely by more robust flavors of earth and coffee.  The finish is medium bodied and doesn\u2019t linger long.  The flavors stay pretty consistent from start to finish.  What it lacks in complexity it more than makes up for in just good solid flavors and a nice finish.  It did seem to pick up in strength a bit in the last third adding a bit of peppery spice to the mix.  I was surprised that this wasn\u2019t a stronger cigar given all the ligero that is in the blend and the Habano binder.  I wonder if that was a side effect of the exaggerated ring size.

These are quick and brief reviews of usually one cigar that I am smoking at a brick and mortar or a cigar that otherwise I just didn\u2019t deem needing a full review. This by no means states that these cigars didn\u2019t deserve a full review, it just means I was a little more spontaneous in taking notes on these sticks. So in these reviews, I just smoke a cigar and take a few notes to give readers a general reference of what they can expect from the cigar. Hope everyone can appreciate these reviews for what they are- quick reviews of cigars I have never smoked before.The exclusivo has a dark brown, leathery wrapper with minimal oils. The cigar gives when squeezed, has a good open draw, and is very rustic looking. The burn was very straight with no touch ups. Draw was consistently open throughout the smoke.1st Third- Deep leather, cocoa powder, meat, and finishes with stinging pepperiness. Full bodied. 2nd Third - Smooths out. Cocoa becomes more prominent and leather weaves in and out. Body still pretty full. 3rd Third- Bitter cocoa flavors with some wood chips thrown in. Stunningly potent smoke.The Exclusivo smokes more like a corona gorda than a robusto extra. The box press makes it seem a little thinner. The flavors are compact, lively, not overly complex, and have a ton of strength (it had me staggering a bit when I walked away). A really solid smoke for one of Cigar Aficionado's top cigars of the year.

Returning from business on the road and back in his easy chair is Nick Sr, my cohort, my friend and my Dad.We decided to go not only private label on this review, but also local.  You see, we live in the same town as the #1 Rocky Patel dealer in New England, Doc James Cigars & Golf.  Being that they have such a solid relationship with Mr. Patel, who is often at events thrown by Doc James, it was only natural to approach him with the idea of a private label cigar.So, in 2006 Rocky Patel decided to produce a private label line exclusively for Doc James Cigars & Golf named DeSiena. In the stable are a Connecticut, a Pennsylavania Broadleaf Maduro and a Corojo.  We chose to review the Corojo.A 6 x 58 Super Toro with a fantastic aroma both pre and post light.  This is a medium bodied cigar made with Dominican and Honduran filler.  The binder is Nicaraguan, and it has a flawless Corojo wrapper.  Brick & Mortar Price Point:  $8.99.On the light we experienced a milder than expected flavor.  Pleasant, but mild.  But this didn\u2019t last long.  The cigar expanded its profile to become much more potent than its start, and layed the smack down on our tongues with a subtle sweetness.  (Why not use the vernacular of another famous Rocky, The Rock of WWE, and now Disney film fame.)  Anyway peeps, the cigar became much better, loosing some of the bitterness that one often gets when a cigar is presenting a milder smoke.OK.  Halfway point and holding steady.  Great construction from an aesthetic point of view:  great cap construction, great Corojo color and as I have mentioned, a nice aroma.  I had a very small issue with a tight draw, but it only lasted a moment.  Most likely a result of my not plugging the cigar deep enough in preparation for ignition.  Dad had a few cracks, but with the crisp New York air at a nipple tweaking 40 degrees and us enjoying our DeSienas outside, it was to be expected.The finish was slightly sweet and pleasant, leading us to agree that this was one to return to.  Dad expressed it best when he said, \u201cThat was a solid $8.99 cigar\u201d.  Don\u2019t expect the world from it, just enjoy its positive qualities while avoiding breaking the bank.  This stick won\u2019t let you down.  Great as a daily go-to cigar.Until next time\u2026Here\u2019s Wishing You A Long Ash!

No, I certainly do not agree with most of the C.A. Top 25 choices however every now and then they do strike a gem (but don\u2019t rate it high enough).  However, I can actually say I was pretty excited to get this long Churchill lit up.  Let\u2019s see how she did\u2026A little back history on the Alec Bradley brand.  Formed in 1996, the Alec Bradley Cigar Company is named after owner Alan Rubin\u2019s two sons, Alec and Bradley.  The Prensado brand hit the markets in 2009, just two years after the infamous Tempus line.  The cigars are rolled at the Raices Cubanas Factory in Danl\u00ed, Honduras and are available in six different vitolas all packaged in boxes of 20.On to the review\u2026The pre-light ritual for the Alec Bradley Prensado Churchill showed a solid performance.  The wrapper had a wonderful dark chocolate color to it however was coupled with large veins throughout.  The cigar did have a semi box press to it and no soft spots were detected on the stick.  Cap is a tad lumpy on the top however applied nicely around the seams.  Smell is of an old cedar chest, touches of cocoa, and a slight barnyard aspect.  The cold tight draw was interesting with tobacco, fruity plum notes.The Alec Bradley Prensado Churchill opened with a wonderful old antique book aroma and was accompanied by a great full bodied smoke however very quickly settled into the mild/medium bodied range.The opening first third tastes were somewhat earthy but mostly bland and non-detectable.  Ash was a dirty dark gray and black with an overall amber hue.  Burn was somewhat wavy but not terrible.  Near the end of the first third the cigar ash began to flower.Moving into the second third the taste department was more of the same\u2026 nothing.  I was trying and struggling to find and pinpoint something in the cigar but there was just nothing!  The aroma was somewhat decent but still not enough alone to hold up what we classify as a good smoking experience.  In fact, after 1 hour and 15 minutes of smoking this cigar I just put it down.  Such a disappointment\u2026My final thoughts on the Alec Bradley Prensado Churchill\u2019s are not good.  In fact, I\u2019m very disgraced that anybody, especially Cigar Aficionado, would rate this as their #1 Cigar of the Year.  This thing is not even close to being smoke-able in my terms.  The taste can be summed up as non-existent, the aroma decent, aesthetics nice, and the price high.  I can assure you I will not be purchasing anymore of these EVER and wish you will take my advice and not waste your time or money on this smoke.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 4 pts.

An insanely loose draw and a hot burn ruined it for me.  Because of that I decided to hold off assigning a rating to the cigar.  I know a lot of people like to make a point of smoking two or three of a particular cigar before writing a review on it. They do this to try and normalize the experience so that they aren\u2019t underrating it because of a fluke with a bad stick, or even overrating it because they happened to get an above average sample.  It is a valid and thorough approach, but one that I don\u2019t use myself.  I take a different tact.  For me first impressions are king.  There are so many cigars out there to choose from and to try.  I give most cigars one shot to sell themselves to me.  Some might think that\u2019s not particularly fair.  After all, cigars are hand made products and there is bound to be an occasional bad stick.  This is true and I try and account for that in a less systematic way than sampling multiple cigars for a review.  The Olde World Reserve Corojo is an example of this.  Normally, I\u2019d have a bad experience, write off the cigar and move on.  But in the case here, I felt I obviously had an unusually bad specimen for my first review.  There were obvious construction issues and I also felt that the cigar showed some promise hidden behind the problems I was having with it.  So for that reason I felt I should give this cigar one more shot.  Another bad sample and I\u2019d write it off as a poorly made line of cigars.  However, that isn\u2019t what happened here.My second try with Rocky\u2019s Corojo version of the OWR was much better than the first.  The draw was 100% better this time around with just the right amount of resistance and the cigar had a very good even burn.  It burned a lot cooler this time as a result and I could now actually taste the flavors of the tobacco instead of just tasting the harsh heat of an overly hot burn.  The OWR Corojo started off smooth and mild with notes of nuts and coffee.  About a third of the way into it, the cigar developed more body and a slight edge.  The flavors were a bit muddled, mostly leather and earth and a peppery finish.  It never really changed again after that.  I found it to be a decent smoke but not really all that engaging.  It is a lot like the OWR Maduro in that respect.  I feel comfortable giving the Corojo a \u201cB\u201d now that I have smoked one sans construction issues.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

This beautiful stick is chock-full of rich Nicaraguan long filler tobacco and wrapped in a chewy broadleaf Maduro wrapper. The pretty blue and taupe colored band stands out beautifully against the wrapper. The wrapper leaf is the color of dark chocolate and flecked with minimal petite veins. There are a couple of imperfections marring the otherwise pristine wrapper leaf, but nothing that should affect the burn. The length of the five-and-a-half inch long stick is plump and skillfully rolled, finished with a prim box-press. The triple thick cap is squarely mounted and cuts cleanly with my punch cutter.The dark Maduro wrapper gives of the gentle aroma of rich dark cocoa and cedar while the foot gives off a spicy odor along with the scent of black cherries. The cold draw is clear and gives off plenty of earthy flavor along with the strong taste of crushed black peppercorn that leaves a peppery tingle on the tongue. Once lit, the first few puffs are bitter and acrid but the flavor quickly morphs to a woodsy base with hints of leather and espresso. Midway through the first third, a nuance of mocha appears along with a natural sweetness left on the tip of the tongue. The second third starts off with more of the sweet mocha from the first but the woodsy base intensifies. Towards the end of the second third, the mocha is replaced by notes of leather and coffee bean. The final third breaks the mold with strong flavors of rich tobacco and white pepper.The 601 Blue Maduro draws beautifully, producing huge plumes of white, flavorful smoke with each puff. The ash is a light gray color with a brownish tinge to it. The burn starts off with some trouble. The flakey ash drops often and the burn line is uneven with the deviation growing to nearly an inch by the second third. A quick touch up fixes it easily enough. The burn is slow, with a total smoking time of one hour and fifteen minutes, and cool enough that I am able to enjoy the cigar to the nub without burning my fingers or having to purge the stick. The ash drops a total of four times.The 601 Blue Maduro is a full strength, full flavor stick with a great draw. Despite the uneven burn, the stick performs nicely. The complex, full mouth flavor easily keeps the smoker\u2019s attention throughout the hour and a quarter smoke.  At just under $10 a stick, it won\u2019t become my everyday cigar, but it is definitely worth a try.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com.

An informant on vacation in Florida tipped me off to its whereabouts.  A plane ride later, I had sequestered the target for interrogation.Appearance/Construction: This target\u2019s wrapper had a nice medium brown hue, with only a few small veins running its length. After sizing up the target a little, I found he had been evenly filled, with no hard or soft spots. In an attempt to disguise himself and throw me off the trail, he wore an interesting pointed cap. I knew after seeing that, that this one was going to be a real character.Flavor: This target was a tricky one. Interrogation began with a woody base flavor - a story he stuck with until the end. Hints of cocoa and slight spiciness lingered between puffs. The most interesting flavor I found was the fresh horseradish finish that the target exhibited. These flavors made for a well balanced and exotic group of natural flavors (not related at all to the exotic flavors one might supposedly find in an Acid Cigar).Evaluation and Termination: Overall, this target\u2019s interrogation was a job well done. The nice balance of flavors and superb appearence really made for a great experience. I would advise all to try and find this target at all costs.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents. Click here for their latest articles and more information.

Upmann (non-Cuban) cigars...These H.Upmann cigars, which have no relation to the famous Cuban brand, are made by Altadis in the Dominican Republic.  They are wrapped in a little used shade-grown Indonesian tobacco known as Indonesian TBN.  TBN stands for \u201cTembakau Bawah Naungan\u201d which according to an article on Indonesian tobacco means \u201ctobacco under sheet\u201d; or in other words, it is shade-grown.  I don\u2019t know off the top of my head of any other cigars that use this tobacco other than another Altadis brand.  It does not seem to be a very popular wrapper choice these days.The wrapper is laced with small veins and is the color of caramel. Outwardly it looks like a very well made cigar, neatly wrapped with a standard cap.  It is well filled with no soft spots and the bunch of the filler looks very well done in both the foot and head with no stems or rib veins visible.  The draw is very good, smooth with just the right amount of resistance.It is no secret that I like lonsdales.  I have stated multiple times that I think the lonsdale is an ideal format for a cigar and that it is my favorite vitola.  I decided to visit the H. Upmann Lonsdale because I remembered that early on in my cigar smoking I used to enjoy this brand of cigar.  I remember thinking that it was a good bang for my buck.  Inexpensive, well made and very enjoyable.  Over the years I have moved away from this marca, not on purpose but rather as just a natural progression.  Other cigars grabbed my interest and the Upmann just faded from memory.  I thought it would be interesting to revisit it now and it seemed natural to try it in the size that has since become my preferred format.  Back when I was smoking these more regularly I was a robusto and toro fan.The cigar started off a little tannic with an unpleasant bitterness on the finish.  It quickly mellowed out.  There wasn\u2019t much there to talk of.  No real flavor, no complexity.  It was just a run of the mill, mild Dominican smoke.  Slightly creamy with a basic tobacco flavor and no body to speak of.  Now I know why I eventually moved away from these.  Near the end it picked up a little bit with just a hint of spiciness and little more body, but it was far too little much too late.  The burn was ok and the ash was a little flaky.  The biggest problem I had was keeping it lit.  It went out several times even though I wasn\u2019t setting it down very often.  This might serve a as decent easy going introduction to cigar smoking for some one brand new to cigars but I suspect, like I did, they will outgrow this cigar quickly.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Neon lighted humidors, barber pole wrappers, car trunk cigar boxes, etc.  The focus has been all on the marketing and gimmicks to the point it seemed as if they had lost touch with just making cigars.  It showed in the quality of the smokes they were putting out too.  Then the go and release the La Taviata.  No gimmicks, no fancy boxes or over the top elaborate modernized bands.  Just a classic style cigar with a classic looking band and even using an old classic Cuban brand name.  Very un-CAO like really.  I have to say they should concentrate on the cigar itself more often, but more on that soon.The Intr\u00e9pido is a BIG cigar.  I called it a double corona in the stats list above, but with a 54 ring gauge it is one big ass DC.  Perhaps calling it a Gigante would be more accurate.  It has a good-looking Colorado wrapper, a little oily and a bit bumpy.  It is finished off with a sloppy looking cap and moderately simple band.  As big as this cigar is, it is packed full of tobacco.  There were no soft spots to be found, the draw excellent and the burn was razor-sharp.After a bit of a peppery start this cigar is very woodsy with lots of cedar and oak as the dominate flavors and just beneath the covers is a slightly sweet spice the balances it out nicely.  I have to think that is courtesy of the Cameroon binder.  At different times during this very long smoke (I smoked this a little north of two hours) I picked up some leather, coffee,and licorice.  I found it to be a nicely balanced and decently complex smoke.  It is a far better cigar than its very modest price tag would imply.  The Intr\u00e9pido is the largest size in the line and it only costs around $6.  CAO departed from their glitzy high-priced and gimmicky approach with this cigar and it is easily the best cigar they have made in the past decade and it is an inexpensive and economical smoke that far outperforms its price tag.  I found it to be a very good medium bodied cigar.  This size however is a bit too large for me.  It was very hard pressed to finish it. I wouldn\u2019t classify this as a strong cigar, but rather because of it size and the sheer volume of tobacco I had to smoke to get through it, I started to feel a little green towards the end.  I think the shorter vitolas would suit me much better.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Extreme, the newest line from CAO, features ligero fillers grown in Estel\u00ed and La Entrada. The wrapper is a deep brown Ecuadorian Habano ligero leaf. Concealing the majority of the wrapper leaf is a large black and orange band. Underneath the large band, the Ecuadorian Habano Ligero wrapper is dark and oily and smooth with a slightly mottled appearance. The length of the six-inch stick is plump and nicely rolled. There are no noticeable soft spots. The thick cap cuts cleanly using my Colibri V Cutter.The wrapper leaf gives off the gentle aroma of barnyard vegetation while the foot lends a savory spiciness. The cold draw is clear and produces flavors of oak and earth. Once lit the first few puffs are slightly acrid but this quickly fades allowing flavors of crushed black pepper and oak shine through. A gentle sweetness develops towards the end of the first third. The second third displays more of the natural sweetness and some black pepper on the back of the pallet. The sweetness surges in the beginning of the final third and then all but disappears. Gentle notes of cedar and oats take its place.The CAO Extreme draws easily and produces tons of smoke. The long, compact ash grows to almost two inches before the first drop. The ash drops a total of two times during the seventy-minute smoke. The burn is cool and even allowing me to smoke the cigar down to the nub.CAO calls this a full strength cigar, but I would rate it more towards medium. It is full flavor and full bodied without being overpowering. The dark, earthy flavors are nicely complemented by the natural sweetness.

The Connecticut wrapper also had lots of veins and seemed to be stretched around the binder and filler bunch.  The perfectly round cap was extremely well constructed.  Pre-light smell was a  wheat and honey sweetness and the cold draw showed a perfect resistance with no defining tastes.The opening of the Oliva Connecticut Reserve was nice and mild.  Draw and burn were perfect with an ash that proved to be a powdery gray.  Notes of wood and grain are found on the palate with absolutely no pepper or spice at all.  A very smooth experience.During the second third the cigar\u2019s performance proved still to be outstanding.  The cigar remained mild, which is not my 1st preference in cigar body, however the change of pace proved to be very much enjoyable.  The tasting still showed woodiness but added a light chocolate moose that lingered in and out.The final third of the Oliva Connecticut had a memorizing bready aroma.  The tastes became a little harsh with notes of charcoal being evident in the final third.  The woody notes remained through the finish and the cigar ended with a brilliant mild vanilla taste.Since the release of the Oliva Serie V line I must admit to having been partial to reaching for that rich full bodied experience offered in the V Series.  However, now that I have been introduced to the Connecticut Reserve I certainly have a slight change of heart.  If you are looking for a nice mellow, mild cigar experience that shows sweet wood and dessert characteristics this is the stick for you.

I had heard it is now a regular production cigar and it certainly seems that way given that they seem to be abundantly available.  It kind of goes against the whole premise that the Master Blends were predicated on, using limited supplies of very high quality tobacco, they were never intended to be regular production cigars.  It seems something has changed\u2026I am huge a fan of the original Master Blends release (see my thoughts on the original review in the comments section below).  I recently had the privilege of meeting Jose Oliva and got him to sign my original Master Blends box.  The original was a Nicaraguan Puro and it is a fantastic cigar.  The Master Blends 2 sported an Ecuadorian grown Sumatran wrapper and was a little disappointing to me.  The Master Blends 3 has a sun-grown broadleaf wrapper which raises my hopes for it as I find Sumatran wrappers to be very hit or miss.  I do enjoy a good sun-grown wrapper though.The MB3 is dressed in a dark brown, toothy wrapper with an oily sheen.  Missing is the laser tattoo that adorned the first two Master Blends.  The box-pressed churchill is a firm cigar with a good heft hinting at the abundance of tobacco that is packed into it.  The construction on this and every Master Blends cigar I have smoked is impeccable.  An ideal draw and an ash that holds its shape and hangs on tight.  You have to break the ash off rather than simply tap it.   Each puff delivers a thick cloud of smoke.  The MB3 starts off with a short blast of pepper but very quickly mellows out.  It is smooth and creamy with a slightly dry finish I like to refer to as \u201csun-grown twang\u201d as it is a flavor I pick up on a lot of cigars with sun-grown broadleaf wrappers.   About midway through the flavors get very woody.  Lots of oak mixed with leather.  In the beginning I thought this cigar would be on the mild side of medium but the further in I got the more it picked up, becoming more of a medium-full bodied smoke.  The last third of the smoke was peppery and had a bit of a bite to it with a very dry finish.I enjoyed the Master Blend 3 a good deal more than I did the MB2, but after a few of the MB3\u2032s I have come to the conclusion that the original Master Blend is still the best of the series.  But the fact is the original MB is no longer available and the MB3 seems to be in abundant supply.  It is a good smoke and sure to be a hit with anyone who enjoys a good sun-grown broadleaf wrapped cigar.  I recommend giving it a try.  At the very least you\u2019ll enjoy it as a good smoke, and depending on your tastes you might find a new favorite.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.As promised, here are my thoughts on the Original Master Blends:This is a special cigar. Master Blends is a limited production, limited release premium cigar. Oliva uses rare and limited tobaccos to create it. The fine Nicaraguan fillers and wrappers used are not for mass production. They are limited amounts of tobacco which would usually be reserved for private family use. Master Blends are available every year; however, each year the blend and wrapper will be different. I have the current release, a Master Blend II currently resting in my humidor and I look forward to smoking it if this original Master Blend is any indication of how good it will be.This was a superb cigar. Full flavored and strong, this cigar gave me a pretty wicked buzz. It had a strong woody flavor and was surprisingly smooth for such a full flavored cigar. I had a problem with the burn. It started out fine but then began to canoe a little on me. I tried to let it correct itself but it kept getting worse so I had to intervene with my torch to even it back out. After that I never had a problem with the burn again. It had a nice firm ash. I only had to tap it twice before putting it down. This was a great smoke and I am going back to the shop to pick up a couple more while they still have them. I plan to stow them away and save them for a special occasion.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/Oliva-Master-Blends-3-Churchill-450x3371.jpg?iv=16"}, "romeo y julieta reserva real robusto": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Robusto Size : 5 x 52 Wrapper : Ecuador (Connecticut Shade) Binder : Nicaragua Filler : Dominican Republic, Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$6 eachMore info about purchasing Romeo y Julieta Reserva Real cigars...", "overall rating": " Not a bad cigar but not a fantastic one either.

The Reserva Real is a very popular blend, along with the 1875. Featuring an Ecuador-grown Connecticut shade wrapper and filler tobaccos from Nicaragua and Dominican Republic, this is an affordable cigar that retails in the $6 area.Appearance :  The cigar has a pale brown sheen to it with some visible veining but the seams are tight and compact.

The burn was exceptional but required a small touch up and re-light near the band.Flavor :  The pre-light aromas were pleasing.  They consisted of mild cedar, citrus and natural tobacco. The pre-light draw provided hints of coffee, earth and a pleasant cedar and tobacco with a hint of spice.The first third gave me some nice smoke output but overall it was inconsistent because of the loose draw. The flavors were somewhat subdued with hints of sweet cedar, earth and a mild coffee.  There were hints of pepper at the back of the palate but this decreased significantly by the end of the first third.As I approached the second third of the cigar most of the spice was gone leaving me some of the same flavors that I got out of the first third.  Some additional sweetness entered the profile with hints of honey, dried fruit and some pleasant saltiness on the lips to help balance the sweetness of the cigar.   The Reserva Real was mild to medium bodied. Getting strong flavors out of this cigar was a challenge with many puffs revealing nothing but natural tobacco.  There was some sweet oily residue on the palate provided by the smoke.  This honey-like texture was present for approximately two thirds of the cigar.The final third had hints of toasted nuts, coffee and caramel.  There were occasional hints of orange peel and some pepper re-emerged.  It had some distinct coffee notes with the presence of some leather and sweet wood. There were hints of earth and hay closer to the band that remained until the end.   Some bitterness entered the profile as I approached the band and this continued until the end of the cigar.  The bitterness was reminiscent of burnt espresso and dark bitter chocolate.The rating doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the flavor was bad.  What I found was that this cigar was quite mild and trying to get some flavors out of it was a chore. Many times it felt like I was smoking natural tobacco but when the flavors came to the fore, they were actually enjoyable.Value :  The MSRP on the Romeo y Julieta Reserva Real is $6.50.

At no time did I experience any nicotine rush.  However, as good as the flavors were, they were too muted and mild for my liking.   Overall, the cigar was slightly above average.

Davidoff and Camacho cigars had always occupied opposite ends of the spectrum.  Everything Camacho put out under the brand name Camacho was a powerhouse cigar.  All of their lines were robust, full-bodied smokes that tried to kick you in the gut.  I know that they have milder offerings under different banners like Baccarat and La Fontana, but anything labeled Camacho was going to be a monster.  SO when the announcement of the purchase became public, I immediately though to myself, \u201cWhat would happen if Davidoff and Camacho got together and had a baby?\u201d  I said to myself a Camacho with a Connecticut wrapper and Dominican tobacco in the filler.  Can you imagine!  A Camacho with that makeup?  And then a short while later we hear about the Camacho Connecticut which is exactly the cigar I predicted.  Now I don\u2019t pretend that I had any great insight or any special talent in predicting what\u2019s next in the cigar industry.  Truth is a lot of people I have talked with had the exact same thoughts I did.  It was easy to see this coming.  SO I want to know, what exactly does a Camacho that uses a Connecticut Shade wrapper and Dominican tobacco taste like.At the start, this cigar is a lot like its other Camacho brothers and sisters.  The first few draws are full and spicy with black pepper and a slightly acrid dry wood flavor.  It doesn\u2019t take long to settle down.  The Ecuadorian wrapper brings what you\u2019d expect to the party.  Creamy notes complimented by some coffee.  It is nicely balanced by a bit of Honduran spiciness from the binder and filler.  I think the Dominican tobacco kind of gets lost in the blend.  Perhaps its function is just to help tone down some of the power of the Honduran tobacco.  The result is a nicely balanced cigar with a medium bodied profile and just a touch of spice to keep it interesting.  I was pleasantly surprised by this cigar and put it up there with Oliva\u2019s Nicaraguan Connecticut Reserve as a good slightly more robust Connecticut offering.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The first cigar made for Smoke Inn in the four part exclusive series was the Tatuaje Anarchy, second - Padron 1964 SI-15 Natural/Maduro, third - My Father El Hijo, and the fourth - unreleased - is supposed to be by Arturo Fuente. This is the largest Padron cigar made to date, a whopping 6x60 monstrocity.

The first few puffs greeted my mouth with rich Nica spice, some citrus, and saddle leather flavors. There are some underlying flavors just beneath the surface of the initial flavors that make this a real complex treat. Clove and cocoa powder stand out as the main hidden flavors pulled from the retrohale. I really am surprised by the amount/intensity of flavor from this 60 ring gauge.The first third started with that complex beginning and then transitioned to more precise, simpler flavors. The cigar now tastes of leather wrapped in chocolate with a spike of red pepper. If you have ever tasted artisanal chocolate with chili pepper, then you know exactly of what I am talking about. Complex no longer, the second third is only being represented by syrupy Indonesian coffee flavors, cocoa, and peppery spice - simple but quite good. The body has ramped up a bit from medium+ to a solid full. Almost into the last third, the retrohale is belligerent and not so appealing any more as my sinus cavity feels as if it\u2019s taking a beating.In the last third the strength meter is dialed up to about 8-9 in my book. Bitter dark coffee, bitter dark chocolate and spice continue to be its defining profile here. I am surprised by the amount of tannin in the last part of this cigar - brooding to say the least. Finishes with a nice return of leather.Value :  If you like Padrons and have had no problems shelling out the dough to get them, then this will be a nice addition to your stash.

In that review I detailed a bit about the makeup and story of the this straight Ligero cigar so click on over and check that out as well.  Today I am smoking the Maduro Torpedo.  I was trying to find some more information about this wrapper and was unable to find anything definitive about it.  I have seen it referred to as a Nicaraguan Maduro, a Mexican Maduro, and even a Brazilian Maduro wrapper.  I am not sure which it is at this point.  I am not inclined to agree with the Brazilian label though.  As Maduro wrappers go this one doesn\u2019t have much tooth to it, and in my experience, the Brazilian maduro is on of the toothiest maduro wrappers I have seen.  That is just an opinion and a guess though.  It could very well be Brazilian, I just don\u2019t know right now.The wrapper on the Cain Maduro  is dark and mottled with a few prominent veins running across its surface.  It has a slight tooth and oily appearance.  This cigar starts off very similar to the Habano.  It is smooth and creamy, medium bodied without much power.  It has a very nondescript, sweet maduro flavor to it.  I began to wonder if this one would pick up in the last third like the Habano did, but it did not.   It was very one dimensional.  The flavors never changed and it never developed any power.  It was surprisingly light for an all ligero cigar and flavor wise it was pretty boring.  The Habano version was much better.  This cigar just never did anything for me.  I\u2019ll be smoking the Habano again, but I don\u2019t have any interest in revisiting the maduro.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

When you walk into the shop the first thing you see is the rolling tables where the Don Francisco cigars are made. There is an amazing selection of cigars there and there is a huge lounge in the back of the store where customers are invited to sit and relax while they enjoy their favorite smoke. It is everything I\u2019d want in a cigar shop. I was visiting family in New Jersey this past Thanksgiving and took the opportunity to stop in the shop.I learned about Don Francisco\u2019s at the HerfHut cigar forum where the owner Lew, is an esteemed member and moderator. While I was there I looked through a case packed full of delicious looking cigars all bearing the gold trimmed red band of the Don Francisco brand. It was almost too hard to choose. I was hoping to find some of the Culebras I saw pictures of over on HerfHut but alas there were none, but another cigar practically jumped out of the case at me. Its distinctive appearance making it a must buy. The Bohemio Knot.The Don Francisco Bohemio Knot has a pig-tailed head and unfinished foot. The wrapper is a very oily Corojo with a mottled brown coloring. The whole effect of the pig tail, unfinished foot and spotted wrapper gives the cigar a very rustic almost tribal appearance. The cigar's appearance makes me envision this cigar as the stick of choice for Dominican Witch Doctors. Below are some closeups of the head and foot on this uniquely wrapped stogie. Unfortunately my sub par camera is not only bad at taking closeups, the flash evens out the color of the wrapper making the pictures poor representations of the actual appearance of the cigar. I wish they came out better so you could see the very cool variations in color that give the wrapper a mottled look. I know that most of the time cigar makers go to great lengths to select wrapper leaves with very even and consistent coloring, but in this case the mottled look works very well for this cigar. I love the look of this cigar and wish my pictures did it more justice. You can click any of the pictures in this review for an enlarged view.Closeup of the Pig Tailed HeadCloseup of the Unfinished FootLighting a cigar with an unfinished foot is a bit of a different exercise than with your typical open foot cigar. You almost have to puff on it during the light to work past the wrapper that closes it off. Doing so creates a bit of harshness at first but it goes away very quickly. I probably just need to work on my technique with these a bit to resolve that.This is not what I\u2019d call a typical corojo. It lacks some of the spice and power that you typically get with this kind of wrapper. However, what you do get from it is surprisingly good. It is very smooth and delivers a very decadent tobacco flavor and it has a a very woodsy core. It has a long pleasant finish with subtle notes of nuts. I also notice that it has a slightly bitter bite on the tip of my tongue that I found unique and enjoyable. The flavors are very consistent throughout the smoke, never changing much. It did start to develop a bit of leather near the midway point that faded away again very quickly. It is a very good medium bodied smoke in both taste and power.I think the Bohemio Knot is a very accessible cigar for all kinds of smokers. It has plenty to offer the experienced smoker who is looking for an easy going smoke that will hold their attention yet a person newer to cigars would find it very enjoyable and not at all overpowering. It is one of the smoothest corojos I have ever smoked. The only negative thing I can say about this cigar is that the ash seemed very loose and flaky and the burn had a habit of going crooked several times, but it wasn\u2019t so bad as to detract from the experience. As house brands go the Don Francisco Bohemio Knot is an excellent cigar. If you ever find yourself in East Brunswick, New Jersey be sure to stop in at Don Francisco Cigars and check out his excellent store and pick yourself up some of these cigars.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I was able to discern that this is a Honduran made cigar and it may be a Honduran Puro, but like I said I couldn\u2019t find much detail on the blend so I am not sure of that.The Epicure has a severe box press.  The wrapper is leathery and rough looking and has a rumpled look near the head.  I can see a couple small stems in the filler at the head and foot.  The draw is good and a little on the loose side.  It produces lots of thick white smoke and has a basic tobacco aroma, nondescript.  The best I can describe it is that it smells like a cigar.  I know, that sounds kind of silly but it\u2019s accurate.  The flavors are a bit plain as well.  It has a basic core of leather and earth complimented by a toasty tobacco.  It was all a bit muddled and one dimensional.  It has decent strength and body.   The finish is OK but can be a bit bitter at times, and the burn is a bit problematic going askew several times.  At about $4 a stick it is a decent value smoke.  The flavors are pleasant enough and with an attractive price point I would say this is a good cigar for out on the golf course or when working in the yard.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

He is based in Grand Cayman which gives him access to some rare Cuban and non-Cuban smokes, including the Opus X cigars.The word alone makes my mouth water. I remember my previous experience with an Opus X and it seems like its strong and rich flavor is still somewhere near. Will this Belicoso xXx, also known as the Power Ranger, be on par with the Rare Estate Reserve or will it disappoint? I had absolutely no idea when I took this cigar from the humidor yesterday evening to dry-box it during the night. The weather is excellent, I am sitting outside in a park and getting ready to begin my short journey to the Dominican Republic.Appearance :  This Dominican puro sports a shiny wrapper with very thin veins. Hard to the touch, it has no soft spots at all. You will probably agree with me that Opus X's bands are among the most beautiful ones out there. I don't really understand the role of the second red band (ribbon) on the foot, but it sure looks good. I knocked off 1/2 star because of a couple tiny discolorations that I spotted on the wrapper.Construction :  I was afraid to experience some construction issues as I noticed that the humidity level in my humidor was higher than usual, that's why I decided to dry-box the cigar for one night. Fortunately, the construction was flawless. The draw was beyond reproach and the burn was slow, steady and regular, resulting in a beautiful, almost white ash that held for well over 2 inches.Flavor :  Belicoso xXx is immediately complex with moderate amounts of spice, leather and the trademark flavor of Dominican puros that I often find in Fuente and Davidoff cigars - that sort of subtle sweetness with a toasty background. It is rather powerful from the very beginning. Beware of the nicotine kick - it will definitely make your head spinning a little (even if you had a hearty meal before playing with this baby). I do not recommend smoking this cigar on an empty stomach. At the end of the first third, one dominant flavor appears - leather. Although there are some other interesting notes, nuts and toasted bread in particular, they are really secondary. I think that leathery flavors are due to the fact that this is a young cigar and the bouquet will be richer with age. Progressively building power, Opus X remains full-flavored to the end, with notes of wood, nuts and earth complementing the leather.Value :  It's quite hard to judge the value of this cigar. Browsing the blogosphere and this very website in particular, it appears that the Opus X Belicoso xXx can be found at $10-12 per piece, whereas some online retailers have a price tag of over $25. At $10 a pop, yes, this would be a steal. At $25, not so sure...Overall Rating :  This review is based on only one cigar. I have two more left and I decided to store them and review another one in exactly one year. I am almost certain that there is considerable room for improvement in the flavor department. See you next year with a more balanced bouquet and at least 4.5 out of 5!This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

I believe it is highly critical of you to judge me on a cigar that you have never smoked as you are to judge me as a bum reviewer. A 4.5 star stick is a >90 score which is a fair score for this really good cigar. When I give 5 stars to a stick I do that in respect to that it is as good as most elite sticks on the market and could be anywhere from a 93-95, or higher if stated. I don\u2019t know what kind of sticks you smoke and what you would judge to be 4.5 star worthy smoke. Wine is like cigars, and drinking based on ratings may not always benefit the drinker. I don\u2019t agree with Robert Parker on wine ratings (but I don\u2019t disregard his opinions either), and you don\u2019t have to like my reviews. If you like another reviewer that has similar tastes as yours, I am not going to fault you for that. I just want you to see where I am coming from with my scoring.", "Aaron \u2014 I don\u2019t think you have to be so defensive.  You write good reviews and, more relevant to this discussion, you tend to review elite sticks.  Obviously, if you\u2019re choosing better sticks to review, the ratings will skew higher.

I always encourage discussion. I hope everybody understands that although there is a star rating associated to a review, the reviewer\u2019s opinion (i.e. the text that has been written) is way more important. These things are extremely subjective and instead of challenging a number it might be more interesting to challenge an opinion :) How can one be dubious over a review of a cigar that he/she hasn\u2019t smoked?

After taking the target out of the cellophane, I noticed a light barnyard-like smell, with a sweet sugar like aroma at the foot. She was packed evenly from cap to foot, slightly springy to the touch. After cutting I found the draw to be slightly looser than I liked, but not annoying in the slightest. After evenly toasting and lighting her up, I tasted some slight spice, and a little bit of a nutty flavor. Approaching halfway, the cigar remained in the mild body range, and had one of the creamiest smoke\u2019s I\u2019ve ever tasted; she continued on like this until I was forced to put her out. Overall, I enjoyed this smoke very much.Recommendation: If you enjoy milder smokes with a little spice and creaminess, definitely give this one a try.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

Newman Cigar Company is responsible for the production of many familiar brands such as Diamond Crown, Cuesta-Rey, Brick House, and El Baton.  In the summer of 2012 the bilingual magazine Cigar Journal published an article/interview with Eric and Bobby Newman, owners of the J.C. Newman Cigar Co.  According to the Cigar Journal \u2018quote\u2019:This line (Diamond Crown Julius Caeser) of super premium cigars was created in 2010 to honor the founder of the J.C. Newman Cigar Company\u2019s 135th birthday and the 115th anniversary of the company.  Julius Caeser Newman\u2019s likeness appears on the cigar label.The Julius Caeser Robusto had a silky, smooth, light brown wrapper that housed a couple of glue stains near the foot of the cigar.  Cap is well applied and I detected no soft spots on the roll.  The band is very elaborate and seems a little large for the cigar\u2019s size.  Pre-light smell is a very rich sweet tobacco, barnyard, and vanilla.  Cold draw shows signs of damp wood/forest and is very tight.The smallest pull on the draw produced a great amount of thin white smoke.  The opening tastes were woody and floral with an aroma that wonderfully noted a creamy, sweet, cookie dough scent.  The burn was wavy with a solid gray ash.  The tight cold draw opened up after the initial light.Into the second third the draw remained great, with loads of smoke produced from this stick.  Burn stayed wavy and the tastes of wood and cedar were still present with an awkward bitterness that started to sneak in.On the last third of my Julius Caeser Robusto the burn had to finally be touched up.  Draw was amazingly great the entire smoke and I would put this cigar in the medium-full body range.  Good thing is the bitter notes I was picking up at the start of the final third did not materialize and instead more woody and earthy tones dominated the palate.This cigar was overall a good cigar and I enjoyed the experience, however the burn was less than mediocre and the taste profile lacked development and complexity.  For the price, I know there are other options on the market that would be just as pleasing for half the buck.Pre-Light:                       8 pts. Smoking:                       7 pts.

I believe, but am admittedly not certain, that this is the only one that is not made in the Dominican Republic.  It is a handsome cigar with a good looking oily wrapper that has the look of leather.  Constrction of the cigar seems to be high quality.  The wrapper is neatly applied as is the double cap.  The draw is ideal and the cigar is firm and well filled.The Habana Reserve is purported to be RyJ\u2019s most robust offering.  That may well be the case but it is far from being a full-bodied smoke and perhaps speaks to just how mild the other lines are.  I am ok with calling it a medium-bodied smoke, but it lacks a lot of the oomph I expect from a cigar made of mostly Nicaraguan tobacco.  I am just not getting that Nicaraguan earthiness.  If i didn\u2019t know there was Nicaraguan tobacco in the cigar and was smoking it blind, I\u2019d probably guess it was a Dominican cigar.  The flavors are pleasant enough, woody and floral, but they are a little thin.  As the smoke progressed it developed a little more body making it more enjoyable if not any more interesting. Towards the end it developed a bit of a peppery bite and a hint of that earthiness I was looking for but was missing almost the entire time.This smoke is a bit one dimensional and doesn\u2019t hold much for the seasoned smoker.

To quote the Garo Habano website:\u201cGaro Habano products have enjoyed a devoted following. Smokers everywhere have praised the quality, consistency and smoothness of our cigars. The company has continued to utilize the finest, most carefully selected tobaccos, the most skilled and passionate rollers, and the most time-honored methods of fermentation and aging throughout our history. The result is a cigar with the same quality, taste and impeccable construction today as in 1996. No shortcuts, no excuses.\u201dIt\u2019s a brisk day in the dead of winter. Agent 24 is in the outdoor smoking lounge ready to embark upon another thrilling mission. After time spent running \u201cBlack Ops\u201d for Santa Claus and training in art of the cigar, I am happy to be back and ready to tackle a new year of cigars.Full disclosure: The Garo Habano cigars I am reviewing were given to me by the manufacturer. Only after acknowledging that my reviews would remain unbiased and honest, did we come to an agreement for the series of reviews. I remain committed to giving an open and honest review.The wrapper on the Garo Maduro is a deep, dark chocolate brown and a bit oily in appearance. It has a few veins and is firm to the touch from head to foot. The initial smell is of fresh cut hay and rich tobacco. After the cut, the cold draw is solid and gives me a slight taste of roasted nuts.From the first light through the first few puffs, I get a dark cocoa taste with a nutty undertone. It leaves a hint of sweetness on the palate. It has started very smooth from the first light. It has a nice creamy finish to each puff and the smoke is thick and white and I enjoy watching it dissipate into the air. The retrohale tickles the sinuses with a hint of spice. It reminds me of a habanero pepper. It is in no way overwhelming or uncomfortable. As I settle in for the journey through the Garo Habano Maduro, I am feeling like listening to one of the all time masters of classical guitar, Andres Segovia.As I get through the first third of the Garo Maduro, the burn has hit a bit of an uneven streak. It is nothing that is going to affect the cigar at this point. We will let it ride for a bit and see if corrects itself. The draw and finish are still smooth and the taste has remained fairly consistent. The most prevalent taste is of toasted walnuts, but there is also that underlying sweetness of cocoa that just teases the taste buds.Now we are over halfway through the Maduro and the flavors on this cigar have remained the same. The retrohale still has that little bit of peppery bite to it, which I enjoy. The burn issue that I mentioned earlier has corrected itself and I am really feeling the power behind this cigar. I was on the fence at the beginning on whether this was a medium or full-bodied cigar, but as we move towards the final third, I am getting that full feeling in my belly and am getting fully into my \u201cmellow\u201d which leads me to declare the Maduro as a full-bodied smoke.As I dig into the last third, the taste is evolving a bit. The cocoa taste has come back to forefront and while I can still get hints of roasted nuts, there is some red peppery spice making its way from the retrohale to regular inhale. It is in no way overpowering or unpleasant and I enjoy the little bit of spice. I am really enjoying the finish on this cigar. It is creamy and leaves a hint of bittersweet cocoa on the taste buds. The burn stayed consistent the rest of the way and the draw was outstanding throughout.The Garo Maduro is a very enjoyable smoke. The taste profile was great and evolved nicely without ever being overpowering. It\u2019s a great smoke for the person who enjoys a solid full-bodied cigar. This is a perfect after dinner, early evening cigar. The price is around $5.50 a cigar, which puts it in a favorable position in the market. I recommend it for any fan of Maduro cigars.

It has leathery rosado  wrapper with a traditional pigtail cap.  I am a fan of the lancero.  I feel that it is a size that lends itself to the ideal blend of filler and wrapper delivering the cigar's true flavors.  The ~hl~ starts off with a blast of white pepper and heavy floral notes with an underlying sweetness that are just fantastic.  My enjoyment of the cigar is enhanced by a heady bouquet of floral aromas.  The whole experience reminds me of sitting down with a fine 16 year old scotch in a way.  The ~hl~ is not as powerful as other Illusiones providing a smooth medium bodied smoke.  Half way through, the floral notes are complemented by smooth creamy flavors of nuts and wood.  In the last third it develops a nice spicy bite.The construction is superb which is hard to do with this vitola that is sometimes prone to draw problems.  The draw was excellent and the burn is dead even.  The ash doesn\u2019t hold for very long which is also common with a lancero so be sure to tap it often or you\u2019ll have ash in your lap.  The ~hl~ is a superb,complex, and elegant smoke.  It is my favorite Illusione.  I have smoked a fair amount of lanceros from Oliva, Pepin Garcia, Litto Gomez, etc\u2026 and I dare say the ~hl~ is the best lancero available today.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

According to the 2011 Volume 16 No.1 issue of Smoke Magazine:\u201c\u2026a special blend limited to only 120,000 cigars in three different sizes\u2026 the new blend commemorates the brand\u2019s Cuban roots, tapping Cuban-seed fillers grown in the Dominican Republic  and Nicaragua, Cuban-seed Dominican binder, and a rich, intensely flavored sungrown Habano Veulta Arriba wrapper from a microfarm in the Navarrete region.\u201dThe Fonseca CXX Anni is available in the following sizes:  46 x 6 3/8 Corona; 52 x 5 7/8 Robusto; and 60 x 4 7/8 Gordo.  Prices range from $7.00 to $9.00 depending on the size.On to the review\u2026The pre-light ritual of my Fonseca CXX Anni first showed a very dark, rough wrapper.  The pigtail cap was off center and the foot of the cigar cut uneven.  The very detailed band complemented the presentation of the cigar and the pre-light smell was a sweet, old cellar mustiness.  The cold draw was tight and hinted at caramel and a moist woodiness.The first third of the Fonseca CXX Anni opened medium/full bodied with a burnt coffee taste.  The aroma reinforced the mustiness found in the pre-light cold smell.  The burn was wavy but needed no correction and the ash a solid ghostly white.  Very nice start to the Fonseca CXX Anni.The 2nd third of my Fonseca CXX Anni clearly showed tasting notes of cocoa and earth but quickly returned to the black coffee notes.  The aroma remained fantastic with the musty overtone however heading into the final third the cigar went out on its own\u2026hmm.  Before burning into the final third I picked up very faint notes of wet leaves and tea.The final third of the cigar was rather uneventful.  The cigar seemed to get \u201cmoist\u201d in the draw and flavors turned vanilla with heavy notes of winter green, similar to a can of dip/chew.  I personally do not like that selection of tobacco choice and these tastes reminded me why.  The aroma faded and the Fonseca CXX Anni finished in the medium bodied category.My final thoughts of the Fonseca CXX Anni are somewhat mixed.  I really enjoyed the opening third and second third the cigar offered however the final third was absolutely pitiful.  The cigar\u2019s performance was decent throughout with an outstanding aroma highlighted in a medium/full bodied smoking experience.  My suggestion is to give this cigar a try but I personally will not be stocking any more in my humidor.Pre-Light: 7 pts. Smoking: 6 pts. Overall Experience: 6 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

Rather than rehash all that here I am just going to cut to the chase today and provide you this link to go back and read the review of the #4 if you are interested. Now on to the good part, smoking the Presidente\u2026The wrapper on this cigar is veiny and a splotchy brown. This is unusual for a Don Carlos. They usually have very few viens and the color is usually very smooth and uniform. The rustic appearance had no adverse effects on the smoke though. It was mellow and smooth, the flavors were creamy and refined. It was slightly sweet, typical of a good Cameroon. I found this one to be a little one dimensional compared to the smaller No. 4, but the flavor was so good it was still a very enjoyable smoke. As is always the case with the Don Carlos, the construction was perfection. the burn was razor sharp and the smoke was thick and creamy. These cigars never disappoint.I used a new style of cut tonight and I have to say I really liked it. I used a double V-cut. This technique was shown to me by my friend Jamie who is a regular at Capital City Cigars in Raleigh. He calls it the \u201cButterfly Cut\u201d. You use a V-cutter to make a small cut across the head, then you turn the cigar and make a second V-cut perpendicular to the first creating a shallow X across the head. It makes for a very clean cut and a good draw. I enjoyed it so much, it may become my cut of choice. Of course, it is best suited to larger ring gauges. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d use it on anything smaller than a 48 ring. I highly recommend you give it a try. I think you\u2019ll find you like it.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

I have worked hard over the years and finally have somewhat of a respectable collection of cigars to choose from.  This time however there were no hard choices or debating to be done.  My mind and palate we craving this cigar and man was it right on!The wrapper on the Padr\u00f3n 1926 No. 2 Maduro is a gorgeous, silky dark maduro leaf.  Just by first glance at the cap you could see the care and precision used to put it on\u2026 just perfect.  The bands on all of the Serie 1926 and 1964 Padr\u00f3n cigars are always appealing to the eye.  Each has a double band with lovely gold outline and writing and every cigar has its own ID number printed on it.  Just another sign of the quality level Padr\u00f3n puts into their smokes.  The pre-light smell portrays an earthy wholeness and the pre-light draw is loose with a rich velvet undertone.The draw on the Padr\u00f3n 1926 was absolutely perfect!  This cigars produces lots of smoke and leaves a pleasant aroma in the room.  Halfway in the burn line got a little wavy and there was a distinct coffee bean flavor present.As you can see there was a wonderful white ash on this cigar, which is said to be a sign of well aged tobacco.  Nearing the end of the smoke the Padr\u00f3n Serie 1926 No. 2 Maduro still produced an abundance of smoke and continued to burn just a bit uneven.Chocolate, spices, coffee... a lot of complex flavors intertwine throughout the smoke. The finish of the Padr\u00f3n 1926 hinted a little pepper and black cherry sweetness.  Very unique and complex leaving me wanting more.  This cigar never dried my palate out, in fact I never needed a drink of water or any beverage.  I would really like to pair this with a good Kentucky Bourbon and see what the results would be!  Euphoria?Let me close by saying the Padr\u00f3n 1926 Serie No. 2 Maduro is definitely a real treat!  Maybe even a dessert cigar or for those special occasions.  I was most impressed with it and commend Padr\u00f3n cigars for the quality and attention they put into their products.  With that quality and care does come a price.  I do consider this cigar to be pricey (any cigar over $12) but well worth it.

The 85th birthday of Jose Orlando Padron brought a new cigar to the Family Reserve line dubbed the \u201c85 Years.\u201dThe 85 Years is one of the best presented cigars currently available. The diminutive box opens to reveal ten stunning box pressed robustos. Each of the cigars fit inside the box like a glove with the center cigar sitting squarely atop a red ribbon. Each dark chocolate wrapper is perfectly uniform in both color and texture. The hastily applied single cap that comes on all Padron cigars does not present a problem while cutting. Like every high end Padron cigar, the draw is perfect with just enough resistance to lend control.Sweet and earthy notes of espresso and dark chocolate linger on the palate atop a background of spices. The richness, balance, and smoothness of these dark flavors add a unique and profound depth to the cigar. Halfway through, the medium strength at the beginning of the cigar ramps up to full. The earthy character gains intensity as the once prominent espresso and chocolate drop into the background. Notes of orange peel and cedar begin to materialize. This is a fairly complex cigar.One of my favorite aspects of the higher end Padron cigars is their ability to deliver bold, rich flavors without attacking and overwhelming the palate with a sharp edge or out of balance flavor. The Padron 85 Years is no different in the way it presents itself; the harmonious medley of rich flavors drops upon the palate like a warm blanket. If you enjoy the flavors laid out in this review I would not hesitate to purchase a box.

It is is a medium to full body smoke that will satisfy lots of cigar palates.  This cigar comes in several vitolas:  a Churchill (7 x 50); a Toro (6.5 x 56); a Torpedo (6.13 x 52), and today\u2019s feature cigar a Robusto (5.5 x 54).  This cigar is a very pleasant, long smoke which does not disappoint.  The Criollo Robusto series contains 70% added Nicaraguan ligero which definitely contributes to the fullness of the cigar.  The Kristoff Ligero also comes in a Brazilian Maduro wrapper.Appearance :  Esthetically, this is a very beautiful cigar; the head has a small pigtail, and it also has a covered shaggy foot which resembles the original Kristoff cigars.The wrapper is brown with a few veins showing in the wrapper.The color of the band is identical to that of the cigar, and it has the word \u201cKristoff\u201d in the center of the band.  It also has the phrase \u201cElite Cuban Taste\u201d on top of Kristoff with \u201cLigero\u201d at the bottom.Construction :  The cigar feels firm to the touch; no soft spots were felt.The pigtail was cut with a Palio cutter, and that exposed enough of a surface to produce a good draw.During the smoke, the light grey ash showed a few loose spots, and it was also flaky.  A good 1.5 in ash was obtained prior to being tapped off in the ashtray.The only deficiency in the construction was that the wrapper cracked during the last third of the smoke. The small crack was about 0.5 in.; however, no smoking issues developed as a result of the crack.The cigar had a very nice and easy draw.  The cigar was pretty smoky and the smoke rose quickly.The band was removed very easily, and none of it stuck to the cigar.Flavor :  During pre-light, the cigar had a salty and spicy taste to the tongue.  Honey notes were detected on the draw prior to lighting the stick.The initial taste after lighting it was that of leather.  At about 2 in. into the smoke, hints of wood primarily cedar were detected.The cigar featured a fairly long finish; definitely, the leather was the predominant taste left in the mouth.The presence of the added ligero definitely contributed to a very rich taste and the fullness of the smoke.Value :  At about $6.50 per stick, this is a great value from Kristoff.  For the money spent, one gets a cigar of good appearance, fairly good construction, and a great flavor profile.Overall Rating :  This cigar offers a great smoking experience.

In 1916 the patriarch of the family, Don Santiago Tora\u00f1o made the move from Spain to Cuba to begin his career in the cigar industry. Eventually his three sons joined him in the family business as the Tora\u00f1os became of of the largest tobacco growers in Cuba. Like a lot of cigar and tobacco families in Cuba, they had to leave after the revolution when Castro nationalized the tobacco industry. The family moved their business to the Dominican Republic and eventually Carlos Jr. moved it again to Nicaragua where it now thrives.The Noventa is made with 5 year old tobacco from the family farms. The cigars are then aged some more before being sent to market, but I could not find any information on how long that additional aging may be. The Santiago is a beautiful cigar wrapped in an oily light brown Habano leaf that looks like it was cut from a piece of expensive leather. It is well filled with not a hint of any rib veins in the filler. On the surface everything about this cigar says \u201ctop-shelf\u201d, including the price tag. Besides carrying the Anniversary moniker, it also carries the anniversary MSRP around $11 a stick, but can be found significantly cheaper online.The Santiago is refined and smooth right from the start. Medium bodied, but mild in strength, it delivers strong notes of nuts and leather with occasional flashes vanilla. The blueish smoke is a little thin but is still delivers plenty of flavor. It has a wonderful aroma that is surprisingly very sweet. It is unique because there is no sweetness to speak of in the flavors but it is very prominent in the aroma. About halfway through this cigar starts to behave like you\u2019d expect a Nicaraguan Puro to behave. It starts to pick up delivering a bit of spice that replaces cream and nuts I tasted at the start. The spice mixes nicely with a woody core and it starts to develop a bit of strength that was missing in the beginning. The last third was more spice with strong notes of cedar and wood. This cigar ended up packing a decent little punch after starting off a bit mild.This was a very good cigar worthy of being an Anniversary edition smoke. Construction was excellent with a perfect draw and a razor sharp burn. It had decent complexity with refined, identifiable flavors. It starts off a bit mild but picks up nicely turning into a solid medium bodied smoke with a good buzz factor without being overly powerful robust. This cigar is a must try for any fan of Nicaraguan tobacco.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

So I figure it\u2019s time to catch up on some reviews. I was hoping to get a review done in December. I managed to sneak it in at the wire.Here is yet another hard to find Fuente cigar. One begins to wonder why so many of their smokes are \u201chard to find\u201d? But I\u2019ll leave it at that before I end up running off on a tangent. The King B is a handsome looking Belicoso. Hidden beneath a cedar sleeve with a black ribbon on the foot is a beautiful Sungrown Rosado wrapper. Reddish brown in color, the wrapper has a few veins running through it but is otherwise unblemished. There is a story that has been recounted in several places where Carlos Jr. tells the story of the King B and how it came to be as well as how it got its name. It is apparently named after an old tavern in Ybor City that his father used to frequent. The Tavern is gone now but will be remembered for a long time now that this cigar bears its name. Carlos Jr. also said the reason for making this cigar in this shape was because he felt the Chateau Fuente line was in need of a pyramid. Maybe I\u2019m mistaken, but I thought the Cuban Belicoso (only available in a sungrown wrapper), which has been around longer than the King B, was part of the Chateau Fuente line so I\u2019m not sure why he thought they didn\u2019t have one. Don\u2019t suppose it matters so on to the smoke.It\u2019s been my experience that cigars wrapped in a cedar sleeve tend to have that cedar take a prominent place in the aroma and flavor of the cigar and it was no different with the King B. The aroma was predominately cedar with a solid tobacco undertone both pre-light and when it was burning. The tapered head clipped nicely and the foot took the flame perfectly. The burn was excellent. Fuente cigars always score big in the construction department. They have very well put together cigars. The ash was firm and well formed and the cigar produced clouds of thick white smoke. The King B starts off very cedary with a slightly sweet spice on the finish. The cedar was always present but as the smoke progressed the cedar mixed with earth and a bit of black pepper. I found this to be a medium bodied smoke. The flavors are pleasant and fairly smooth making it an accessible and enjoyable smoke for most cigar smokers. I really like the Belicoso shape and while this was a very good cigar, my personal tastes put my preference with the Fuente Cuban Belicoso. I find the Cuban Belicoso to be a slightly more robust cigar with more interesting flavors. Plus it is a little easier to find than the King B, but only a little easier. The King B is certainly worth a try and if your tastes tend to gravitate toward medium rather than full bodied or mild cigars then you may find this cigar to be a favorite.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The strongest flavor coming through is a leathery and earthy combination, along with a rich nut taste and then some dried fruit to round it out.  The dried fruit has a raisin taste to it, the earth has a peaty undertone.  There are hints of spice on each draw but it doesn\u2019t linger at all.  As I progress into the 1st third the earth flavor increases in intensity.Second Third:Moving into the 2nd third the spice that was only a hint previously picks up nicely as the earth drops in intensity.  You\u2019re left with earth and spice playing off of each other with just the faintest hint of an oaky backdrop.  There are a few draws of bitterness in the middle of the second third but they quickly disappear.Last Third:The spice from the 2nd third drops off and you\u2019re left with a nice mild balance of nuts, wood and earth: a smooth finish.Burn / Draw :  I initially had some issues toasting and lighting, but it could be as a result of the humidity and altitude.  I\u2019ll have to revisit the stick in a few weeks to see if it was just a one off.  I had no stalling issues throughout the smoke, and the draw was exactly where I would want it to be.Overall smoking time was a leisurely hour and 45 minutes.Value :  I picked these up as a 5 pack for $16.95, which worked out to approximately $3.40 a stick.

There is the 601 Red wrapped in a spicy habano wrapper, the Ecuador Connecticut wrapped Black Label, a sweet maduro Blue Label, and the dark and oily Green Label Oscuro.  The EO brands are the realization of a dream of two friends, Erik Espinosa and Eddie Ortega.  Their partnership with Pepin Garcia have produced a handful of excellent cigars.  In addition to the popular 601 Serie cigars their collaboration also brought about the Cubao and Mi Barrio which are also beginning to generate some buzz in the industry.The Green Label 601 has a dark oily wrapper laced in very small veins. Although it is a perfecto, the taper isn\u2019t very severe except right at the foot. The taper to the head of the cigar is shallow and if it weren\u2019t for the nipple at the foot it would look very much like a pyramide. As you would expect from a cigar made by Pepin Garcia, the construction is excellent. It has a near perfect draw and burn. It has a good heft to it so you know it is packed full of tobacco. It burns slow and cool producing firm pepper gray ash that wants to hold on for ever.The oscuro is supposedly the strongest most full bodied of the 601 line. Personally I found that wasn\u2019t the case. While certainly a full bodied smoke, I think the Red Label Habano is fuller and much stronger packing a bigger punch than the Green. Where the Red is a blast of pepper and spice, I found the Green to be smoother with a maduro sweetness, just a bit of spice and little or no pepper. That said it is still an excellent smoke. At the start there is lots of cocoa and coffee with notes of cedar and leather all wrapped in that sweet maduro flavor. At about the halfway mark most of those flavors fade and all that remains is a sweet core with occasional hints of coffee. As the smoke progresses it doesn\u2019t change much. Sweet with a creamy feel and a bit of leather. At the start I was expecting a real complex smoke and though it is by no means one dimensional, it lacks the complexity of the Red and doesn\u2019t have anywhere near the strength I was expecting. I know it sounds like I am a little disappointed with it and in some respects I guess I am, but I still think it is a very good full bodied and enjoyable smoke. It is an excellent cigar if you are looking for a full, flavorful cigar that won\u2019t kick you in the pants.  Of course that is just my opinion.  A lot of people think this is a powerhouse smoke.  I gravitate to strong smokes so my opinion may be skewed.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Fuente in the Dominican Republic, the Don Carlos No. 2 is claimed to still be one of the finest cigars on the market.  Being released to the public in 1997 and said to have vintage aged tobacco (10 years) these cigars are typically difficult to come across.  The Don Carlos line consists of seven different sizes each available in boxes of 25:The first thing I noticed about this cigar was the very pointed tip on the cap.  The wrapper was a beautiful oily brown with little to no veins.  There was one black spot located near the foot of the cigar and with further inspection I found glue reminisces all over the top/cap of the cigar and some near the foot.  The band was a typical Arturo Fuente band with red and gold embroidery.  I was unable to detect anything worth noting in the pre-light smell however the cold draw parted me with heavy mint and tea notes.  Hmmm, this could be interesting.The first third of my Arturo Fuente Don Carlos No. 2 was very sweet and woodsy.  This medium bodied start had a perfect draw and velvet smoke that burned quickly into the start of the second third.Heading into the second third the cigar tended to burn uneven but produced a wonderfully white brittle ash with some gray tones throughout.  The cigar turned leathery into the second third and the uneven burn continued.  Again it seemed as if this cigar was burning very quickly so I had to better pace myself in order to fully enjoy the aged tobacco flavor at the end of this third.With only the final third to go the Don Carlos No. 2 was heading for victory in my book.  The cigar\u2019s outstanding effortless draw helped the cigar find its way back to the woodsy undertone with primary taste being nutty.  The Don Carlos No. 2 started out medium bodied but ended mild/medium.This cigar is a truly great example of what Arturo Fuente cigars is all about.  I personally tend to enjoy the Don Carlos line more than the Opus X as I find them to be more consistent.  The Don Carlos No. 2 showed great complexity and class.  If I could change anything about this experience it\u2019s that the cigar would have burned slower.  It took me roughly an hour to smoke this cigar and typically a cigar this size takes me anywhere from ninety minutes to one hundred and twenty minutes to finish.  My suggestion is, if you can find these cigars don\u2019t hesitate to buy them, in fact\u2026 stock up!Pre-Light: 7 pts. Smoking: 9 pts. Overall Experience: 9 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

Feel free to check out their selection of fine cigars.Examining my humidor, I discovered this attractive cigar in a size (5.5 x 42) that I deemed suitable for the rainy winter time. This brand was launched in 2010 and is considered as a personal cigar by Guillermo Leon, the owner of the La Aurora company.Appearance :  The Guillermo Leon Corona is like a tour of tobacco producing countries in the America, with contributions from the Dominican Republic, Peru, Nicaragua, Brazil, and Ecuador.

Aside from this construction problem, they are quite good.Overall Rating :  (3.75) Aside from the construction issue discussed above, which impacts my perception of the value, I\u2019d highly recommend these cigars to anyone who enjoys complexity, but also likes their cigars to have subtlety and a sense of continuity.  It\u2019s quite a unique cigar given its unusual construction with the dual binder and the tobacco from so many countries.  If you purchase a box of 20, the price per cigar is more reasonable, between $6-7 a stick.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Lucky for me, I recently had the luxury of a gorgeous sunny day with an atypical high of seventy degrees Fahrenheit and commit myself to taking full advantage of it.  Opening my humidor, a sampler nestled safely at the front that I had received from Heavenly Cigar Company catches my eye.  Noting that the cigars have been resting for a few weeks by this time, it seems like the perfect opportunity to test this as of yet unfamiliar cigar out.  Toting my newly acquired prize to the front porch I sit down to enjoy the Red Lion.After settling down, I take in the overall look of this robusto sized smoke.  Dark brown tobacco creates a flawless wrapper with a very sturdy double cap.  Despite being a new cigar, there is a slight oily feel, which I do not recall on other fresh release smokes in the past.  Reflecting on this, I recall that the cellophane removed was actually slightly tinted as well thus making me contemplate whether or not the samples were actually a slightly aged.  Pinching the barrel reveals a strong fill with a slight spring.  A barnyard scent exudes from the foot and the prelight draw is of toast with a lingering sweetness left of the lips.  When sampling the draw, it comes across as very loose despite the dense filling filler.Initial impressions when lighting is that this smoke has a strong bite that cannot quite be placed.  It continues to have sweet undertones as well.  Copious amounts of thick white smoke accompany the still loose draw yet sharp burn.  After a few more puffs, the sweet develops into a more definitive raw sugar taste.  Moving into the first half inch to an inch, the only way to really describe this cigar is that it has a light flavor with a powerful undertone.  There is not a whole lot of flavor beyond the bite of cinnamon but the sugar serves to balance it out almost like red hot candies.With the too easy draw and loose ash, it becomes incredibly difficult to keep this cigar from burning too hot.  Becoming more bitter than spicy at about the one inch mark, it progresses into the realm of acrid by the second third.  Despite my best attempts the warmth of the barrel indicates that the flame has reached more than half way down the length and far outpacing the burn of the wrapper.  If I let the cigar sit it does allow the bite to subside and sweetness come out.  Unfortunately the result is that the cigar burns itself out.Overall this smoke was pretty flat.  The bite was not really a positive for me.  When picking this smoke I selected the firmest of the sample received and it still drew loose and burned hot.  The flavor was just not there and because of the burn I am contributing it to the construction as well.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

Given that fact, I am not going to bore everyone with a lot of fluff on this review.  If you don\u2019t know about them, a quick Google search will tell you all you need to know.  It seems like a lot of cigar smokers, especially the newer ones who haven\u2019t had a chance to try these, go to great lengths to run the Hemingway Maduros down.  If you haven\u2019t had the pleasure of a Hemingway Maduro, the thing you need to be aware of is that they only come out twice a year.  Just before Fathers\u2019 Day and again just before the Christmas Holidays. Those are the times to be on the lookout for them.While I enjoy most of the Hemingway Maduros, I find the WOAM is the one Hemingway Maduro vitola that is truly special.  It seems to me that there is something about this specific size that the blend and the Maduro wrapper are perfectly suited and the result is amazing.  The WOAM is the one Hemingway Maduro that I will still go to some lengths to find.  I\u2019d hate to ever find my humidor without a few of these resting inside.So, you already know I like these cigars so my final opinion isn\u2019t going to be a surprise, but let me tell you all about my experience smoking this particular WOAM\u2026The dark maduro wrapper is very rough and rustic looking.  It\u2019s bumpy and veiny and has a dry look to it.  The aroma of the cigar is a rich tobacco with a hint of cocoa.   This unique perfecto is a great shape with a fat bulbous foot that ends in a small nipple at the tip, and a steady taper down to a perfect 46 ring gauge at the head.   The draw is always a little tight at first but it opens up quickly once you get the burn up onto the bulb of the foot.  Construction has always been consistently perfect on these.  I\u2019ve smoked many and never had any issues with burn, draw, or any other part of the construction of these stogies.The WOAM starts off smooth and easy with coffee and nut flavors.  As I made my way up to the thickest part of the cigar I also found earthy notes and lots of dark chocolate.  As I progressed down the taper earth and wood become the dominate players but there are still nice notes of cocoa here and there and a bit of maduro sweetness on the finish.  The last third or so is a lot of wood and earth with some pepper and spice as well as it becomes a bit fuller and more robust.  An excellent finish to a stellar and complex smoke.  The Hemingway Work of Art Maduro is a real treat.  Christmas is right around the corner so these should be showing up in cigar shops again soon.  Perhaps in a month or two so keep you eyes out.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

The Indie looks well rolled. The only thing I don't like in this cigar is its main band; the colors as well as the skull & bones are not my cup of tea.Construction :  As I said, the Indie looks well rolled and, indeed, there are no soft spots or other construction imperfections. All of my samples smoked really good, with a consistent ash, nice draw and regular burn. The smoke output is very good as well. The only problem is that the wrapper is quite fragile, so you need to pay special attention while cutting the cigar and/or removing the bands. It does crack easily.Flavor :  (3.75) The pre-light draw is quite spicy and there is indeed a lot of spice when I light the cigar. It settles down quickly though and the main flavor appears that will be present throughout the cigar: wood (cedar). All tobacco used in Core Zero is pre-aged for 3 years, and it shows because mature tobacco notes are definitely there. Additional flavors include hazelnut and burnt coffee. The cigar is mild to medium and never gets out of this range. The flavors are quite consistent from start to finish, no spectacular evolution here but it doesn't get boring either.Value :  A 5-pack retails for $25. Five dollars for this kind of cigar is a good value, IMO. The Core Zero Indie is a good cigar to enjoy with friends, giving away a couple.Overall Rating :  Overall, the Indie is a pleasant cigar that provides balanced flavors and quality construction without breaking the bank. I would like to thank Bryan again for sending me a sampler of these!This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

The limited production Master Blends are the other top shelf line from the Olivas. One thing I noticed on the Oliva site is that they have an aging recommendation for their cigars. The Special S apparently should be aged for five years. I find this a little strange, because to the best of my knowledge Oliva does not date their boxes. I could be wrong because I haven\u2019t bought a whole box of Oliva\u2019s since I bought my box of the original Master Blends several years ago. However, if I\u2019m right and they do not date their boxes, the aging recommendation seems kind of silly to me because there is no real way to know how old the cigars are at the time of purchase. I guess you\u2019d have to start counting from when you bought them. Anyway, as far as I know, this Special S is nowhere near 5 years old. It has been in my humidor for about 2 months.The Special S is a handsome looking cigar with an elegant presentation. Unfortunately I failed to take a picture before I put the cigar to flame and this one certainly deserved a photo display. I was unable to find an adequate picture anywhere on the web to share with you here. Thanks to the cigar band collection at StogieFresh.com I am at least able to display the band. In addition to the elegant band you see above, the majority of the cigars length is hidden in a cedar sleeve that is decorated at the foot with a deep brown band printed with the words \u201cSpecial S\u201d and the Oliva \u201cO\u201d logo in shiny gold lettering. The overall effect is a beautifully presented cigar. I have heard a rumor the the Special S\u2019s days are numbered and that there are plans to discontinue this line. I have not been able to find anything to confirm that. I also heard the Master Blend 3 will become a regular production cigar, effectively replacing the Special S as Oliva\u2019s regular production, top-shelf smoke. Again, these rumors are from a single source and I haven\u2019t been able to find any more information on this to confirm it. If it does turn out to be true and you are a fan of the Special S, you may want to think about stocking up.Even though the Special S sports some nice duds, the cigar can hold its own in the beauty department even if it were naked. The Ecuadorian Sun Grown wrapped used on these smokes is flawless. Smooth with only very tiny veins, it is milk chocolate in color, has an oily sheen, and is perfectly applied to a well filled cigar. I clipped the tapered head with my trusty Palio and tested the draw. It was too tight so I trimmed a bit more off the head in hopes of opening up the draw a little more. It didn\u2019t seem to help so I was left to hope it would loosen up a bit during the smoke. As it turns out it didn\u2019t. The cigar wasn\u2019t plugged and it was certainly smokable, but I had to pull harder than what feels comfortable to me. By the end, my jaw was tired and I developed a bit of a headache because of the tight draw. Other than the draw, which was probably a fluke and not common, there were no other construction related issues. The burn was perfect and the ash firm and well formed. Flavor wise this cigar was pretty good, but nothing I would call \u201cSpecial\u201d (pun intended). This was a very smooth smoke, medium bodied, and medium in strength. I tasted good flavors of leather and coffee and there was a bit of spice on the finish. The cigar never changed, never did anything to make me think wow, just good solid flavors that remained consistent from start to finish. Near the end it became difficult to keep the cigar lit because of the overly tight draw so I put it down a little sooner than I probably would have otherwise.The Special S is a good smoke that is refined and smooth. Construction seemed excellent except for the draw problem and the flavors are very enjoyable but one dimensional. I would hope for a bit more from what is supposed to be a premium cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

They are fantastic cigars and even the cheapest of the line, the white banded P series is pretty darn good for a mixed filler yard \u2018gar. Tatuajes have been dominating my smoking rotation as of late which is why they also have been dominating my recent reviews as well. So keeping with that theme here is yet another Tatuaje review. This time I put an RC233 to flame.I spent the better part of Saturday reorganizing my new garage. I had two reasons for doing so. Number one, I needed to make room to move even more junk from storage to my garage, and number two it was time to get the man room setup. The garage is my room, the \u201cman room\u201d if you will. It is a great place of refuge from the chaos that goes on inside the house with a wife, two small children, a dog, and a bird. So I needed to clean up the garage and get my new (but old) 42 inch rear projection TV and sitting area setup in the garage. After all it was opening day of the college football season and if ever there was a deadline to have your man room ready, that would be the day. By the afternoon everything was set and I was chilling out watching football. Fast forward to the end of the greatest football game of all time as my alma mater, Appalachian State University (2-time defending 1-AA National Champions) put the beat-down on big bad Blue in the Big House!!!! I was jumping through the roof! I\u2019m still riding that high today. I wanted to smoke the biggest darn stogie in my possession to celebrate. None bigger than the RC233.So off to the humidor I go and I pull out the 9+ inch foil wrapped perfecto. This is a good looking beast of a cigar. The size of it is a little intimidating and I know I\u2019m settling in for two and half hours or more with this bad boy. I explained the name of the Tatuaje RC\u2019s a bit in my post about the RC184, but for a quick recap, the RC stands for \u201cRetro Cuban\u201d and the 233 represents the cigars length in millimeters. The RCs are limited in production making them kind of tough to find so when you come across one grab it if you ever intend to try them. Given the heft of the RC184 I expected its bigger brother to feel even heavier in the hand but was surprised that it didn\u2019t. It seemed a little light for its size to me. A google image search located this handy picture showing the two RC\u2019s side by side.The head clipped nicely with my Palio. Like most perfectos getting it lit was a bit tricky. You need to get the burn up past the taper at the foot before the draw opens up enough to keep from popping a blood vessel while taking a draw. Once I got it going the draw was good but a little on the tight side. I don\u2019t know what Pepin does to his cigars that gives almost every one of them that trademark pepper right at the start but it was present on this cigar as well. Once I got a little over an inch or so into it the cigar mellowed dramatically. This is the mildest Tatuaje I have smoked so far and I\u2019ve smoked many of them. The flavors were predominately coffee and cedar. I kept hoping for more flavors to develop or for the cigar to change things up a bit, but alas it did not. I have to admit I was a little disappointed. The flavors were quite good on this medium bodied smoke, but the cigar was a bit one dimensional. That\u2019s not good for a cigar that boasts such a long length. There was still almost four inches left on the cigar when I found myself losing interest in it. I had gotten all I was going to get out of it and there was still about 45 minutes of smoking left on it. I persevered through the rest of the smoke but began paying far more attention to the football game then I did the cigar. It was a good cigar with superb construction, a good even burn , and good(albeit one dimensional) flavors but far too long and far too expensive for the experience it delivers. This is the 1st time I\u2019ve found myself disappointed with a Tatuaje. I was especially surprised by this since the RC184 was an absolutely stellar cigar. Maybe it was a fluke, maybe not. I have two more in the humi and I\u2019ll give it another shot the next time I\u2019m in the mood for a two and a half hour smoke.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I don\u2019t know\u2026Cloaked in a white shroud and tattooed on the foot with serial number 234679, this character showed a level of sophistication. For the price, it betta\u2019 be no hobo, yo. What?So as the interrogation started (blade and flame), much more information followed. Plenty of rich tobacco and leather/cedar but nothing of unique interest to me. Decent burn with 3 touch-ups, nothing stellar. Flaky ash. No harsh flavors or severe construction problems.I don\u2019t really understand the hype surrounding this particular character aside from the packaging gimmick. Awesome exterior package, mediocre guts inside. I am a big fan of CAO products but this one let me down.

This cigar drew a lot of rumors and buzz at the time of release due to its extreme exclusivity. Only 5 mystery B&M\u2019s got bundles of these self promoted \u201cPrototype Cigars.\u201d Andre Farkas stated that the White Labels would be cigars that would be released to the public as a test blend to possible future releases. This release of the White Label is a tweaked blend of last year\u2019s Summerfest blend. I truthfully disliked the Summerfest blend, but thought that with some adjustments to the blend and size, that this cigar could have been much better. I happened to get a hold of many of these cigars in the hopes of putting some good age on them. But I had to smoke a couple to see where they were at in their evolution.Appearance :  Nice looking corona gorda with dark brown wrapper with two prominent, medium sized veins running down the side of the cigar. This was medium in weight in the hand and tightly packed with no soft spots. Not much scent on the wrapper at all. Oiliness and sheen to the wrapper has me drooling and excited to spark this one up.

Typical Viaje construction in my opinion- hardly a single flaw. The Raices Cubanas factory is one of the best in the biz when it comes to construction. Very good quality control.Flavor :  From the very start I was hit with a surprising amount of spice. This spice lingered in the back of my mouth, tongue, and throat, and sides of my mouth for a little while. I thought immediately that these needed some more time.  After the spice blast died down a bit, flavors of flowers and leather come out. Retrohale reminds me of sandalwood. At this point I can definitely identify its lineage from the Summerfest(SF) blend. The strength seemed a bit stronger than the original SF blend. I got a significant amount of woodsy flavors about 2 inches in. Currently the aroma is the best thing going for this cigar as the retrohale is very much enjoyable with its intoxicating floral notes. Second third evolved into leather and milk chocolate flavors. The cigar started to gain some strength near the end of the 2nd third and I started to get pretty dizzy. This one definitely delivered a sneaky dose of vitamin N! The last third ended with espresso notes, and eventually concluded with me putting this one down near the middle of the band due to it getting too hot.Value :  The value in this one all depended on where you got them and how much you may have been shafted for.

The store has changed location over the intervening years, but it is still a big name in NYC.

Rolled at the Joya factory the MUWAT Bait Fish was officially released at the 2011 IPCPR trade show and is exclusively sold through New Havana Cigars out of Columbus, Ohio.On to the review\u2026The pre-light on the MUWAT Bait Fish showed a very dark, almost black, wrapper with small veins running throughout.  The cap on both examples I smoked was extremely sloppy and I found one soft spot near the foot of the first sample.  The band is simple yet somewhat unique and the smell is a heavy barnyard with black tea notes.  The cold draw showed no definite tasting notes and could be classified on the tight side.*Note: I usually review cigars in the typical 1/3\u2019s style however due to the size of this cigar I only took time to make notes in the first and second half of the smoking experience.The Bait Fish opened with strong bold black coffee notes.  The thick white smoke produced gave way to an aroma with a semi-sweet tone.  During the entire first half the coffee notes intensified with an added sweet taste I found present on my lips and tongue.  This little chimney had a surprisingly full-bodied punch to it.  The burn was great and the draw remained firm but was not terrible.The second half (final half) was more of the same in the taste department with the cigar adding some earthiness and spice to the finish.  Both the burn and draw performed well with no relights or touch-ups necessary.  Overall it took me only 35 minutes to smoke this stick down.My final thoughts of the MUWAT Bait Fish are good.  The cigar wasn\u2019t terribly complex in the taste department however it offered a nice full-bodied experience with good performance qualities.  Again, if you\u2019re an outside seasonal cigar smoker and have to bare those cold winter months this cigar would be a perfect choice to get your fix without freezing yourself silly.  I probably won\u2019t be purchasing a bundle of these however I could see a couple of 5 packs in my future.Pre-Light: 7 pts. Smoking: 8 pts.

It is an eye catcher on the shelves.  I have to be honest.  I am not a fan of Macanudo in general (although I was recently impressed by the new Gran Cru), but when I saw this cigar with that big metal ring on it, I had to buy it just to try and also to have that band.  For what I don\u2019t know but I had to have it so I guess the gimmick worked.  The flavors are mild and classic maduro, a slight sweetness with chocolate an coffee flavors.  The flavors were a little thin though with not much body to speak of.  The draw was a little looser than I prefer but it did produce plenty of thick aromatic smoke.  The burn was a little tricky at time requiring one or two touch ups and the ash was very loose and flaky so I had to keep an ash tray nearby.The final verdict, while it was an OK smoke, it was too mild for my tastes and too thin in the body department.  The ash was kind of troublesome too.  However, the flavors were good and in the end I guess I enjoyed it enough to be happy with the purchase though I probably won\u2019t be looking to smoke another.  However, if you like mild smokes and that classic maduro sweet flavor, this cigar is right in your wheel house.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I did not find any issues or problems with the wrapper or the construction of the cigar but holding it in my fingers, it did feel a bit on the dry side. I believe this is due to my own humidor and not reflective on the build of the cigar. The band of the cigar, a simple yet pleasing looking band, uses great typographical elements to really complete the look of the cigar on the whole.Once again using a punch and butane lighter, I was greeted with an open, easy draw complemented along with a plethora of complex flavors. Being that we are approaching the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons, the first flavors I noticed with this cigar comes hand-in-hand with these seasons: light cinnamon and nutmeg. I also detected notes of leather of leather as well. The combination of flavors hit the back of my throat like a truck and lingered throughout of the duration of the cigar; a welcome change to the recent milder cigars that I have reviewed the last few times. It is also why I consider this a step up from a medium strength cigar. The dark ash clung to the cigar well; I ended up tapping it off after a half inch or so.I did find that the cigar did burn a bit uneven. Throughout the hour and a half smoke time, I did have to relight to correct the burn a couple of times. Again, I do think this was more because of my own humidor than the cigar.Recommendations: While the Cuvee Blanc was a great cigar for both the newcomer to cigars as well as the die-hard connoisseurs, the Illusione CG4 in my opinion is a great match for those who want a slightly stronger medium bodied smoke and who can appreciate a cigar with a collection of complex flavors. Couple that with a middle of the road price point, it would certainly be worth anyones time to give this cigar some attention.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

Kurt Kendall of the K.A. Kendall Company has brought back the R.G. Sullivan produced cigar that went out of business in 1963. The 7-20-4 name is based off of the street address of the original factory in Manchester: 724 Pine St. I was originally gifted one of these from Dan Welsh of New Havana Cigars. I had placed an order and when I opened the box, there was a 7-20-4 in there with my original order. After giving it a run, I have since ordered more and here we are!It\u2019s raining; it\u2019s a little chilly out. Not gonna be able to have the normal out on the patio smoke today, so we have moved to winter smoking lounge, aka the garage. I know, high class; but hey, you do what you gotta do! So, hoodie on, staying warm and let\u2019s get this mission started.The wrapper is dark brown in color, oily, has a few veins, very firm from head to foot, it has the pig tail on the head, which I actually like and I think gives the cigar a unique appearance and has the smell of dark chocolate and fresh cut hay. The initial cold draw is solid and doesn\u2019t give any hint of issues. I taste an underlying sweetness along with some cedar.The initial draw on the 7-20-4 is outstanding. I am immediately hit with dark chocolate, toasted nuts and it finishes with some nice spice! Thick billowy clouds of white smoke surround me and I am falling into what I call my \u201cmellow\u201d immediately. The retrohale tickles the taste buds and leaves a little bit of spice. I like some spice, so for me, it is pleasant. That being said, it is not overwhelming at all and I think even my fellow cigar smokers who don\u2019t like spice as much as I do will find it to their liking! We are backing up the 7-20-4 with some good New York Hardcore, H2O is first up! \u201cMy friends look out for me like family!\u201d (Very appropriate, in that if not given the original 7-20-4, my mission would not have taken place!)As I get through the 1st third of the 7-20-4, the burn has stayed even, the draw and finish are solid and the taste has evolved. I still taste the dark chocolate (has to be the Brazilian Mata Fina wrapper, one of my favorites). I am now enjoying some undertones of earth and the spice has turned it up a notch, I like to label my peppery tastes, and this is straight black pepper and I like it! Still not overwhelming and leaves a pleasant touch on the retrohale. My \u201cmellow\u201d is in full effect, even with the NYHC playing in the background. Civ is up: \u201cCan\u2019t Wait One Minute More\u201d. Very true, I cannot wait to continue through this cigar!Now we are over halfway through the 7-20-4 and it is still going strong. No burn issues at this point. The flavor profile has stayed true from the 1st third. Dark chocolate, earth and that black pepper. I am getting some little bits of sweetness teasing me at each puff. It\u2019s there, but it doesn\u2019t want to fully show itself. Very unique! Still with the NYHC and back to H20 and \u201cWhat Happened?\u201d I will tell you what happened: as I delve deeper into my mission with the 7-20-4, I predict big things for this cigar as the year goes on!As we move into the final third of the K.A. Kendall\u2019s 7-20-4, we had one minor burn issue which corrected itself quite quickly. The flavor profile has taken on a new identity! That sweetness I talked about earlier has gone from being a tease to moving to the forefront. It reminds more of a milk chocolate versus dark chocolate. The little bit of bitterness you get in dark chocolate is gone and you are left with the sweetness. The sweetness is being perfectly balanced with the black pepper and also, I am getting hints of cedar. It really has become quite complex. Each pull from the cigar brings a different experience. From strength perspective, I would give it a high medium to low full rating. Time to nub this bad boy and put this mission to bed!K.A. Kendall\u2019s 7-20-4 is an outstanding addition to the cigar community! I enjoyed the complexity of the flavors throughout. It kept me on toes throughout and did not disappoint! I believe that you will hear more and more about this cigar as time goes and the positive feedback is well deserved. Thanks again to Dan Welsh for turning me onto these sticks!

It uses aged tobacco in the entire blend and at 6 years old, the binder is the youngest tobacco in the cigar.   With such a mix of aged tobacco I was expecting something packing a lot of flavor.  This particular line \u201cThe Connoisseur\u201d is a very new release that only started shipping to stores this past April 2013 and, according to my research, most stores started receiving their batches in May and June.   I\u2019ve never tried a cigar from this manufacturer so while in Chicago recently I happened to come across it and decided to give it a shot.  It\u2019s always good to venture out of one\u2019s comfort zone in the hopes of finding something new.Appearance :  Mild to moderate veining is noted with tight but somewhat visible seams.  The J Fuego Connoisseur comes in a cellophane wrapper and comes double banded with the primary logo dominating the cigar and a smaller very thin band around the foot of the cigar listing the company name.  There is certainly no pretentiousness evident in this cigar and, unless you knew this cigar was a manufacturer\u2019s top of the line cigar, you wouldn\u2019t tell by the appearance.Construction :  The grand robusto was firm to the touch with good give-back.

The Connoisseur held up well to my guillotine cut with no cracking of the wrapper.Flavor :  Pre-light aroma had notes of sweet wood with a touch of earthiness as is usually expected with Ecuadorian Sumatra wrappers.  There was a very slight hint of citrus on the nose with a mild floral bouquet.    I could not tell that this cigar had been manufactured just recently. The use of aged tobacco throughout the entire blend certainly has much to do with this.  The pre-light draw provided pleasing sweet coffee, natural tobacco, a touch of salt and spice on the lips with some sweet wood notes.On lighting you are greeted with very good smoke output.  The first few draws reveal a pleasant sweetness with hints of dried fruit and sweet woodsy tones. There is a touch of salt on the front end of the palate with medium long spicy finish.  There are nice aromas of fruity oak with mild hints of dark coffee discernible on the tongue in between puffs.  Most of the first third goes from fruity to woodsy with fantastic smoke output. The spice can be felt at the back of the palate on every puff and is best described as a cayenne like heat as opposed to a black peppery spice.  You definitely know it\u2019s there but it never overpowers the cigar.As I started the second third I noticed a pleasing caramel-like sweetness to the finish. The spice had mellowed a tad but was still present. The cigar offered a nice balance of salt and sweet on the lips and the cigar was primarily woodsy and earthy.  The cigar\u2019s flavor profile continued to surprise with occasional hints of sweet fruity oak, mild earth tones, some leather, cocoa and unsweetened coffee flavors dancing around my palate. The finish was sweeter and had just enough spice.  At times I had to take two or three consecutive puffs to get a good mouthful of smoke simply because of the firm draw.  I don\u2019t like doing that though as it has a tendency to warm up the cigar hotter than it should, leading to bitterness and an unpleasant hot smoke. While this was a minor issue, it was a notable one nonetheless.The smoke, while thick, did not have as creamy a texture to it as I had anticipated.  Instead it was a \u2018dryer smoke\u2019 with very little in the way of texture or palate residue to it but it did offer up some occasional pleasing hints of caramel.  The cigar offered up some bold flavors that at the same time remained subtle with no one flavor overpowering the cigar.  It was a very pleasing blend. The aged tobacco definitely helped in this regard.As I passed the halfway mark a touch of bitterness was noted.  Hints of dark unsweetened chocolate and roasted unsweetened espresso came through.  The spice at this point became much milder.  The flavors morphed into more natural tobacco with more earthy notes dominating the cigar and the palate. There was still a touch of salt on the front of the palate that balanced the earthier, less sweeter tone that the cigar took on.The cigar continued to surprise with subtle but noticeable flavor changes yet again as I worked my way towards the final third towards the band. The aforementioned bitterness subsided and the cigar became sweeter again with hints of fruity oak, cedar, caramel and sweeter cocoa along with the underlying earthy and leather notes. The heat at this point was more of a familiar black pepper spice.This J. Fuego Connoisseur should be smoked after a full meal.  It definitely has some strength to it.The  flavors became significantly more muted as I neared the band with the cigar almost instantly morphing into a bitter plain tobacco smoke.  Maybe it was the cigar\u2019s cue that it wanted to be put down. I was unable to knuckle burn this cigar as the cigar became quite bitter and harsh rather quickly.  With approximately 1.5 inches left and well over an hour into the smoke I laid it to rest so as not to let it ruin my experience.  By the end it was mainly an earthy grassy cigar with some very mild bitterness and leather notes.  The sweeter oak and occasional cedar notes had long since disappeared but I did pick up some faint toasted nuttiness with some lingering black pepper spice.Overall a flavor score of 4 is well above average and warrants purchasing a few more.  A little more age in my humidor should do it wonders.Value :  For $10.00 MSRP and actual cost paid, you get a very good cigar that will last for approximately 90 minutes.

Fernandez\u2019s boutique brand, La Herencia Cubana, has been earning rave reviews from cigar enthusiasts worldwide as one of the best boutique brands available. The CORE, with its blend of Nicaraguan and American long filler, is no exception. Enveloping these delicious long fillers is a Nicaraguan Habano binder, and a dark, oily Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. The wrapper leaf is the color of dark chocolate and flecked with a few raised veins. The length of this short stick is well-filled and perfectly tapered to a wedge. The cap is perfectly mounted and cuts cleanly with my perfect-cut guillotine.The wrapper leaf gives off a gentle scent of earth and cocoa bean while the foot lends some dried fruit to the aroma. The cold draw is clear and produces thick flavors of cocoa, toast, and earth. Once lit, the first few puffs are thick with dark, earthy flavors. The wrapper leaves the strong flavor of crushed black peppercorn on the lips. The pepper dissipates rather quickly, allowing flavors of earth and wood to steel the focus. A distinct leather finish develops in the second third while the wood flavors deepen. Rich tobacco, leather, and earth dominate the final third but a delicate cocoa nuance peaks through.The La Herencia Cubana CORE draws perfectly and produces huge plumes of thick, white smoke with each puff. The burn line is pristine, producing a strong, compact ash that grows to nearly two inches before the first drop. The ash drops a total of three times during the fifty-five minute smoke. The burn starts off cool and slow but heats up quite a bit during the final third, making it difficult to smoke down to the nub.La Herencia Cubana\u2019s CORE is a delicious stick. They call it a full strength stick but I would put it more in the medium category. I absolutely love the tapered cap of the Dagger vitola, it definitely increased my enjoyment of the stick. A.J. Fernandez constantly exceeds my expectations. Bravo.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com. Click here for her latest posts.Nice review.

Fuego cigars, like me!\"The Fuego family has been in the business of growing, blending, and making cigars for five generations. Established in 1876, J Fuego was founded as a leaf growing company in \"El Corojo\" farm, Cuba. In 1995, the family moved to Central America and in 2006, after years growing, blending and producing cigars for other companies, Jesus Fuego launched \"Tobacos S.A.\" with the release of the \"J Fuego brand...\" (jfuego.com).The Judge cigars are brand new exclusives you can only find at Famous-Smoke Shop. The blend was crafted by no other than Jesus Fuego.The Mata Fina is named after where it is grown, is a reference to one of the four major growing zones in Brazil.This cigar is GOOD! Such a smooth draw, even burn and stayed that way to the end, consistent full tobacco flavor with a medium body of taste and aroma. The Judge Blind Justice is not finished with me yet! That's just a sample of what this cigar will smoke like after some time in my humidor! My first J. Fuego cigar and it was a purchase well worth making.

When I'm in a foreign B&M looking for my cigars, weeding though sticks with similar 'busy' bands can be frustrating. The look of the Panacea band may be simple and basic, but it accomplishes so much. The cigar had a nice even weight and was spongy-firm from head to foot.

Both sounded like cigars that I would really enjoy. So I added them to my ever growing list of cigars to try and then semi-unexpectedly I received a pair of Panacea Black Robusto Maduros from Paul Bush, the owner of the Flat Bed Cigar Company.  (Cigar Inspector told me to watch for some samples, but I was surprised to see they were Panaceas.)Well after a short rest in my humidor I pulled them out over the weekend for review.  Here are my thoughts.Appearance :  The Panacea Black sports a deep cocoa Brazilian maduro wrapper. The band is a soft black (to match the name, the Panacea Red has a red band) with white lettering and has a large \"P\" and some gold highlights. Now Flat Bed Cigar Co. is upfront on their website when it comes to appearance as far as keeping things simple and basic. Too often I see such 'busy' bands. When I'm in a foreign B&M looking for my cigars, weeding though sticks with similar 'busy' bands can be frustrating. The look of the Panacea band may be simple and basic, but it accomplishes so much. The cigar had a nice even weight and was spongy-firm from head to foot. There was one dominant vein and some wrapper color variation, but again Flat Bed Cigar Co. says they are focused on taste and less on aesthtics in what they describe as the \"age of cosmetic selling\". \u00a0 Construction :  Both samples had the same exceptional construction. From the well placed cap practically popping off with the encouragement of my cutter. To the medium resitance of the draw, which was consistent from start to finish. From the near razor sharp burn (one sample became uneven in the final third) perfectly creeping the length of the cigar. To the light resting smoke, slowly following the soft air currents.Flavor :  The Panacea Black has a simple but delicious flavor profile. The pre-light draw had hints of sweet earth and wood. Once lit, the subtle sweetness remained for the first two thirds. Then sweetness make a gradual transition to spice through the remaining third. The body remained pleasantly medium throughout.Value :  I'd say these are one of the better values available. At around $5.00 each you'd be hard to find something to complain about, but plenty to rave about.Overall Rating :  My impressions of the Panacea Black before smoking them were correct. This stick is right up my alley. While these are not available locally (yet) in my market, I look forward to the day they are.  Until then I will be ordering more from Flat Bed Cigar Co. These are an incredible find in an ever expanding cigar industry.

This one is part of the Hemingway line. The entire line of Hemingway cigars are very hard to make perfectos because of their unique shape. Carlos Jr. tells the story of how the Hemingway cigars came to be on their website. He are some small excerpts from that story:Ever since I was a child I was always fascinated with that shape, the old world, and the really difficult art of the craft that the Cuban Perfecto cigar represents\u2026\u2026Today we make all these cigars and also a few very limited shapes such as the Work of Art, Best Seller, Untold Story or the Between the lines as well as others. These cigars are extremely difficult to make so our production is very small. We accumulate the limited production of these cigars in the aging rooms and usually release them around the holidays, something special for our fellow cigar smokers to enjoy. (Carlos Fuente Jr., Cigar Family Website)Carlos doesn\u2019t elaborate on why they chose Hemingway to name this cigar after. I think there is a perception in the general public of Earnest Hemingway as a cigar smoker, probably because of his macho persona and the bravado his personality portrayed. I think that the fact that there is a cigar line named after him just served to cement this misconception in the eyes of a lot of people, but the truth is he was not a cigar smoker.Hemingway later said that Cuba held many attractions for him\u2026 What he evidently did not find of interest in Havana were cigars. Although he had learned to smoke Russian cigarettes during the First World War, and once described himself in a humorous 1935 story about Key West as \u201csitting on the verandah enjoying a cheroot,\u201d he told a writer in 1950 that he didn\u2019t smoke because it diminished his sense of smell. In The Sun Also Rises, Count Mippipopolous makes a great ceremony out of clipping his cigar with a gold cutter and proclaiming \u201cI like a cigar to really draw,\u201d but apparently that was a procedure and preference Hemingway rarely practiced. (Cigar Aficionado Profile)I have been a fan of the Hemingway cigars for a while now and the Best Seller along with the Short Story and Work of Art are my favorites in the line. The size and shape of these cigars make them fun, complex smokes that can be easily enjoyed when the mood strikes because they are usually no more than an hour commitment. You can drag them out because the burn is slow and cool, but if you don\u2019t have all day they fit the bill nicely. I am also a lover of the Cameroon wrapper, and the perfecto shape, so this cigar has a lot to offer me.There are a couple reasons I love a perfecto. Number one is aesthetics. They are beautiful cigars to look at if well made. The curves and sloping lines are pleasant to the eyes and knowing how tough it is to wrap a shape like this and the kind of skill and artistry that goes into making them enhance this. Have you ever tried to wrap a gift that had an odd uneven shape? I\u2019m not a good wrapper anyway, but with a gift like that the wrapping job usually comes out looking more like a damaged package from UPS rather than a gift. The other reason I like the shape is because it lends itself to a more complex smoke. When the cigar starts off narrow, there is less filler mixed with the wrapper and so the wrapper plays a larger role in the flavors of the smoke to start. As you progress through the smoke and the burn starts to widen into the thicker part of the cigar you are burning more filler and the wrapper\u2019s role is less dominate and the flavors begin to change. It\u2019s not long before the cigar begins to narrow and the flavors begin to change again. It makes for a complex, attention holding, fun smoke. This has been my experience with the Hemingway cigars including this Best Seller.When you first light the nipple on the foot of the Best Seller you get a blast of Cameroon that is more sweet than spice. The cigar quickly opens up as you smoke up the taper to the thickest part of the cigar. The Cameroon takes back seat to a woody/cedar flavor with a subtle nutty undertone. Once you get past the bulge, the cigar starts to taper down to the head. As I progressed through the smoke the Cameroon flavor gradually picked up in intensity once again becoming the dominant flavor toward the end. The finish is a pleasant cedar that doesn\u2019t linger longer than it needs to. The construction is impeccable and the burn is perfect. The Best Seller is a wonderfully complex yet mild to medium bodied cigar. I have never been disappointed by this cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I have talked about them at length in my posts on The Frank and Boris.  I\u2019ll just do a quick summary here.  The Drac is the second in a limited edition series of cigars by Tatuaje that is release around Halloween every year.  They are extremely limited and highly sought after making for an extremely hard to find cigar.  Last year I was lucky enough to get a whole box of The Frank.  This year I wasn\u2019t so lucky but I did manage to get my hands on two of The Drac cigars.The Drac is a large Torpedo that comes in a shiny black lacquered, coffin-shaped box.  The torpedo shape imparts a fang like or stake like image either of which is appropriate for a cigar named after the world's most famous vampire.  It has a black and red band at the foot and is stored in its coffin upside down with the foot of the cigar at the top of the coffin just as Dracula was reported to sleep in his coffin upside down.The Drac delivers pleasant medium bodied flavors of wood, earth, and leather with subtle sweetness on the finish.  The draw was excellent, but the burn on my first sample was not good at all.  It required constant attention continually becoming uneven.  The ash was very flaky and did not hold well at all.  The cigar also went out on me twice during the last half of the smoke and it wasn\u2019t due to inattention as I was trying very hard to keep the thing burning right and lit.  These kinds of construction issues are not at all typical of Tatuaje cigars and based on what I have read about The Drac, they really aren\u2019t at all typical of this smoke either.  I think maybe I just got a bum stick or maybe I didn\u2019t give it enough time in the humidor to settle in.I have one more Drac and I am going to give it some significant time to rest in my humidor before I revisit this cigar.  Flavor wise it was a very good and very enjoyable smoke if not as complex as most other Tatuajes, but the burn issues really detracted from my enjoyment of it.  Whenever I have a cigar that performs this way I chalk it up to a likely fluke and I make plans to revisit the cigar in the future.  That is exactly what I plan to do with The Drac.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of Tatuaje the DracAs I hold this cigar, I get an ominous feeling that this cigar is going to have a lot of bite!Its dark Habano wrapper is very nice looking and smooth to the touch, not much tooth on the wrapper.As I light the cigar, I expect to get a kick of Pepin pepper and spice, but I get a smooth earthiness mixed with leather and tobacco notes.There is a bit of white pepper in the exhale, but this is definitely smoother than I thought it was going to be.As I smoke further I begin to get an idea of what this blend is all about.  Like the vampire, it lures you in to its lair, and then \u201cBam!\u201d  The flavors really begin to pick up.  A little more spiciness, some cayenne mixed with cinnamon, with a nice cocoa aftertaste on the finish.What is especially strong is the aroma, very peppery and meaty, the burn is almost dead even, and I only need to touch it up once to get to the finally few inches.The last third comes not out of Transylvania, but Hershey, PA.  Milk and dark chocolate fleet in and out as the intensity of the flavors build to a diabolical crescendo.I liked this cigar, but compared to the Boris, it still fell short for me.  There was really nothing specific to complain about, just a preference to the Boris over the Drac.

This cigar uses two wrappers, a Connecticut Shade wrapper at the foot with an abrupt transition to an Ecuadorian grown Sumatran wrapper for about the last 2/3rds of the cigar.  It starts off fairly mild with creamy coffee notes and a bit of hay and then picks up in strength and body once you hit the Sumatran wrapper where there is a bit of pepper and leather and earth with what I thought was a slightly overbearing finish.  Maybe even a little harsh at times.  I found it to be a well made cigar.  The burn was amazingly slow.  It took a long time to smoke this Toro.  I\u2019d rate this stogie overall as \u201cgood\u201d.There was something about the two wrapper setup and that transition from the mild smoke to a more medium bodied experience that I am unsure about.  I cannot put my finger on it, but it is different from the changes and nuances of a well blended and complex cigar that only uses one wrapper.  I\u2019ve struggled with it but haven\u2019t come up with a good explanation for my feeling on it. Still, this LGC is a decent smoke and the gimmick is legit and so it it is worth trying at least once for the experience.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of the La Gloria Cubana Artesanos de Tabaqueros ToroThe idea behind the line is an appetizer and main course all-in-one.  The 1st third has a Connecticut Shade wrapper \u2013 the appetizer, while the rest has an Ecuadorian Sumatran wrapper \u2013 the main course.The wrapper joint is obscured by the band which is oddly on the bottom third of the cigar, making it seem that you may be smoking it upside down.  I remove the band and notice the seam.  It is straight as an arrow \u2013 the construction looks real nice on this one.  It is also very firm to the touch but with a satisfactory pre-light draw.It starts off as expected, mild.  There are creamy woody notes and a hint of leather.  It was fine, I just found myself waiting for the next 2/3rds.The next 2/3rds was very much vintage LGC.  Slightly spicy, with some coffee thrown in for good measure, it had nice flavor and balance.  I would not call it full or med-full, it was a nice solid medium body cigar.  It doesn\u2019t change too much during the last third, although it does get a little more coffee-y (new word) and picks up some cocoa notes.All in all it\u2019s a good cigar just a little uninteresting at times.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/La-Gloria-Cubana-Artesanos-de-Tabaqueros-Toro-450x3371.jpg?iv=16"}, "jameson red label": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Corona Size : 5 x 44 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade Binder :  Honduran Filler : Aged Dominican Hand-Made Price : ~$5 eachMore info about purchasing Jameson Red Label cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "jameson", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/jameson/jameson-red-label", "full review": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Corona Size : 5 x 44 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade Binder :  Honduran Filler : Aged Dominican Hand-Made Price : ~$5 eachMore info about purchasing Jameson Red Label cigars...Striving for the highest quality, Jameson Cigar Co.\u2019s sole strategy is to bring their love and appreciation of cigars and coffee right to the consumer through their product lines.A few weeks ago, a communication came through the wire: Brad Mayo of Jameson Cigars was inquiring about any interested parties wanting to give a tasting to their private-label coffee line. Being that I am never one to pass up a great chance to try test or beta products, I replied back to the message, informing him that I was also interested in their cigars, as no local B&M\u2019s carry their product. Not only did he send along the coffee, a couple of cigars found their way into the shipment as well.The look-over on the Jameson Red Label shows their commitment to quality. No imperfections were found on the wrapper and the cigar felt properly rolled throughout its length. The wrapper had a slight feel of oil to it, which I am a fan of. I also detected a slightly sweet aroma to the cigar.Using a cutter and butane lighter for this cigar, I was welcomed with a quick hit of dull spice right at the onset. The spice did not stick around for more than a few minutes, followed by hints of wood. The cigar smoked straight up medium bodied, balanced perfectly. Nothing harsh to the taste, just pleasant. I didn\u2019t feel the finish to be any longer than normal for a cigar of this strength. If anything, it was a bit on the shorter side.A great draw for this cigar with my cutter. Open and effortless. It also left a sturdy, gray ash. I never felt like I had to be near the ashtray at all times. The thick smoke from the cigar was also a nice touch. It\u2019s always a bit disappointing for me to smoke a cigar and end up with puny, thin smoke.It\u2019s a great down-the-middle medium bodied cigar, perfect for a morning smoke with the coffee or something for the evening. The price is very fair for this cigar and I think it\u2019s something that both new smokers and seasoned pros can enjoy.

Though small in stature, don\u2019t let its looks fool you to what is lurking within this stick.Construction :  (3.75) Raices Cubanas doesn\u2019t make shabby cigars, so I didn\u2019t expect this cigar to be anything less than almost perfect. The oily wrapper burns very slow, and combustion of the foot, when first lighting, was a little difficult. The draw had a perfect amount of tug, and the smoke was plentiful and thick. The ash looked like crap though with blackish char all over it. The ash held on for 1 inch chunks before bending under its own weight and dropping off. The burn was not thoughtless though, and a few touch ups were needed throughout the smoke (not a big problem though).Flavor :  I thought this would be an easy smoke when I decided to smoke it late in the night for this review,\u2026\u2026.Wrong! Instead, the 1st third hit me with a full onslaught of rich saddle leather and hints of flower and anise notes. The underlying deep chocolate notes provides a sturdy backbone to the flavor profile = delicious. The first few puffs were medium bodied and quickly switched to full bodied in a heartbeat. The flavor is very much full and overwhelming. The smoke emitted off the foot is fragrant like pipe tobacco.While I was able to retrohale somewhat comfortably for most of the 1st third, I would no longer be able to do that going into the 2nd third. My sinus cavity had to take a step back as the strength of the smoke kept elevating in this cigar. Flavors were then turning towards the darker side of things. The flavors moved on to heavy amounts of leather, meat, dry cocoa powder, dark chocolate, and raw coffee bean flavors in this part of the smoking experience. It\u2019s a real treat if you like your cigars with the Liga Privada / La Flor Dominicana profile.Getting closer to the last third of the cigar, black pepper spice is very prominent and a chocolate malt ball flavor starts to take over. Strength remains full+, this little guy is a firecracker.Value :  Most would think that $7.80 for a corona sized cigar is a lot, but the MK delivers for its price tag. Take in consideration that the \u201cDirty Rat\u201d is around the $11-$12 range and most would come to the conclusion that this is a bargain stick.Overall Rating :  Dion has a definite hit here with the Ultra MK. This stick definitely gives the \u201cDirty Rat\u201d a run for its money. In my opinion, I would rather smoke this for the coin than scour the earth for a \u201cDirty Rat.\u201d This vitola really lets this superior wrapper leaf shine, and flavor \u201cBOMB\u201d is a perfect summation of what you will expect from this stick. If you like your cigars full bodied/full flavored and strong as balls, then you will love this. La Flor, Litto Gomez, and Liga Privada smokers will really enjoy this stick. Even though I haven\u2019t written a lot of reviews of Dion\u2019s cigars, I do smoke a lot of his products. To say the least, this is nowhere similar to anything else he makes. This cigar is a totally different animal (a beast!). This is so far the best cigar from Dion Giolito I have had so far. Thanks to Abdul @ Habana House for recommending this stick for me. Hopefully you guys out there will be able to enjoy this stick too. \u2018Til next time,\u2026This post was written by Aaron.

The VSG Series cigars are blended exclusively by Carlos Fuente Jr. with 4 and 5 year old Dominican tobacco.   The wrapper leaf is grown in Ecuador by the Oliva family and sold to the Fuente family exclusively for Ashton VSG cigars.  The VSG Series comes in 12 different sizes for your smoking pleasure (a lot of these vitolas have already been reviewed on CigarInspector.com, click on the name to read the corresponding review):Eclipse \u2013 6 x 52; Wizard 37 \u2013 6 x 56; Pegasus \u2013 5 x 54; Enchantment \u2013 4.5 x 60; Tres Mystique \u2013 4.5 x 44; Belicoso No. 1 -  5.25 x 52; Corona Gorda \u2013 5.75 x 46; Illusion \u2013 6.5 x 44; Robusto \u2013 5.5 x 50; Sorcerer \u2013 7 x 49; Torpedo \u2013 6.5 x 55; Spellbound \u2013 7.5 x 54The Ashton VSG pre-light ritual was as good as it gets.  The cigar had a wonderful dark, rich looking wrapper.  The band was yellow, ravished in gold, with black lettering and red undertones.  Very appealing to the aficionado\u2019s eye.  Cold draw showed signs of woody sweetness and the cigar lit up very easily.  This very large Ashton VSG Spellbound passed the pre-light test with a perfect score.  Great to see such high quality!The first 1/3 of the cigar showed aromas of wood and spice with notes of roasted nuts.  The burn was a little uneven however the ash was a tower of wavy white glory.About half-way through my Ashton VSG Spellbound the roasted nut notes were still present however heavily supported by woody cedar affluence.  The burn was still uneven and seemed to be working to fix itself.  I checked for soft spots before lighting up however did not feel any, so this uneven burn was kind of a mystery.  The Spellbound produced loads of thin white, velvety smoke.Just as I thought the burn did fix itself.  It never was perfectly straight however I didn\u2019t have to use my torch to touch this monster stick up.  The ending aromas were floral.  Very refreshing and pleasing from start to finish.The Ashton VSG Spellbound was a very consistent, solid smoke offering everything I want and expect in a good cigar.  Even though this cigar may seem pricey it is certainly worth the money and time, taking me a little over two hours to smoke.  I will definitely be trying other cigars from the Virgin Sun Grown Line and maybe stock a few Spellbounds in my personal humidor.  Fantastic smoke!Pre-light: 10pts. Smoking: 8pts.

The Maduros are especially limited and are only released twice a year, one of those times being right around now, near the Holidays.  One of the more rare of the rare is the double wrapped, barber pole Hemingway \u201cBetween the Lines\u201d.  Now plenty has been written about the background of the Hemingway cigars and I have written about them here before as well.  So if you are interested to learn a little more about them, check out my review of the Hemingway Best Seller.The Hemingway BTL is an eye catcher.  The sharp contrast created by the light tan, shade grown wrapper and the dark, toothy broadleaf maduro wrapper intertwined like the stripes on a barber\u2019s pole is a cool visual with a cigar.  They stand out among the cigars that surround them and I think the perfecto shape only enhances the beauty of this cigar.  Construction and burn characteristics are almost always a given with a Fuente cigar.  The quality of their products are superb but I wondered how this stick would fare in the burn department.  The shade grown and maduro wrappers are two very different beasts and have different burn characteristics.  I was curious to see how they would play together with this smoke.  Except for the normal oddities I experience with the burn at the beginning of a perfecto like this, the burn was even and without trouble for the duration of the smoke.  The draw was excellent and it produced thick clouds of white smoke.Flavor is where the BTL falls a bit short of its straight maduro brothers.  I have always found the Hemingway Maduros to be delicious cigars, each one a treat to smoke.  The introduction of the shade grown wrapper on the Between the Lines has a less than desirable effect for me.  Some of the flavors I love about the Hemingway Maduros were still there.  The slightly sweet maduro flavor complimented by a damp earthiness and a subtle spice were all there but often times they were overpowered by a dry grassiness and an acrid finish that I am certain was coming from the Connecticut Shade wrapper.  It really detracted from my enjoyment of the cigar.  Given that this is one of the most expensive of the \u201cHoliday Hemingways\u201d it is disappointing that it just isn\u2019t as good a smoke as the others are.  It is a neat novelty, and the dual wrapper look makes it a visually appealing cigar, but flavor wise I just don\u2019t think it lives up to the standard set by the rest of the Hemingway line.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I smoked this cigar on a recommendation by Wade Howard following a review I did of the Panacea Green Label. From my previous reviews, everyone probably knows that I am a big fan of AJ Fernandez\u2019s cigars (see the Man O\u2019War cigars reviews) and also, I have grown very fond of the Pennsylvania Broadleaf wrapper.

As always, the detailed tasting notes accompanying the score give the best insight into the unique character of each individual cigar. \u00a0- NathanIt isn\u2019t every day that a long out of production cigar hearkening back from the boom years of the \u201890\u2019s falls into your lap. The Texas Cigar Brothers company of Bedford, Texas recently stumbled upon a long forgotten stock of El Sublimado and El Incomparable cigars in the warehouse of a Honduran cigar factory and is making them available on a limited basis. The El Sublimado brand launched in 1993 and is unique because the tobacco used to make the cigar was cured in rooms with 50 years old Noces d'Or Cognac.This cigar does not possess an overpowering aroma of cognac; the spirit\u2019s scent on the wrapper is unmistakably present but is well balanced by the natural aroma of tobacco. The prelight aroma is a subtle mix of vanilla, toffee, spice, cedar, and tobacco. Deftly rolled with a beautifully uniform look and feel, it is clear that the El Sublimado was manufactured with care. The Connecticut seed wrapper remains rich in appearance and sill exudes a modest amount of oil.Unlike the majority of infused cigars, the El Sublimado\u2019s flavors are nuanced and delicate. The flavor of the Cognac is even less pronounced while smoking than it was in the aroma of the unlit wrapper. It remains rich and full of undertones but strikes a refreshing balance with the other flavors one would expect to find in non-infused tobacco. The smoke tastes of nuts, vanilla, and spice with a lingering finish of cedar. The 50 ring gauge robusto burned very evenly with a draw offering modestly firm resistance.At around $17 per cigar, the El Sublimado is not inexpensive; however, it is very unique and worthy of purchase due to the unusual flavor combination. Lovers of an elegant cigar brimming with vivid flavors and a mellow texture should consider purchasing a package of five while they last.

Prominently displayed upon entrance to my local shop, I'd been eyeing this 54 ringed beauty for the longest time and for the price, I can't for the life of me figure out why up until today I hadn't tried one. Something about this stick just screamed mediocrity and a flashy band with no flavor to back it up, galvanized by the fact that one of my smoking buddies had one a few months back and spent the next 6 hours with his head in the toilet... Would I be pleasantly surprised or would my intuitions be unfortunately confirmed?Flavor :  The story of the first third of this cigar is that of competing sweetness': abundant sweet spice with sweet cedar and a distinct sugar-sweetness on the finish, along with fruity notes and a hint of vanilla. As it progresses, the flavor gets meatier and more leathery. At the end of the second third the flavor profile becomes wine-like with a predominate cherry flavor and a finish reminiscent of a nice smooth petit syrah. The cherry flavor remains in the final third, with the spice kicking back in until about the 2 inch mark where bitterness rears its ugly head and the finish turns noticeably chemical.Burn/Ash :  The burn never stays straight for too long and is slightly wavy throughout. The burn never got out of hand and I didn't have to do any re-lights or touch ups but it was definitely something I had to keep my eye on. The ash was reasonably firm and held strong. I think throughout the course of this 6 inch cigar, 2 ashes fell and the 3rd was holding strong when the flavor got bitter and I finally set it down after about an hour and 15 minutes.Draw/Construction :  Though the draw remains perfect throughout, the cigar's construction is mushy and I believe the burn issues can be attributed to all of the soft spots that I noticed on the pre-light inspection.Value :  Some of you may think I'm being too hard on manufacturers and shop-owners but the way I see it, if a cigar is worth exactly what it costs that's expected, that's 2.5 stars.

It is unique in my opinion because it seems to be universally respected among cigar smokers as a good, tasty, quality cigar.

I have enjoyed them so much over the years that it wasn\u2019t until now that I have ever bothered to try another vitola, but this time I am smoking a toro.  It starts off with a bit of black pepper and a spiciness that is reminiscent of the Petite Corona only not quite as sharp or robust.  The flavors seem to be muted or muddled in the translation to the large ring gauge.  I get hints of the coffee, earth, and spice that I love in the Petite Corona, only they are faint and muddy and not as pronounced.  I was a bit disappointed with this one.  It seems to me the blend does much better in a smaller format.

He may be the best in the country. I first met Chris Harper when he was working for another cigar manufacturer. He now works for Perdomo and apparently they recognize his talents as well because he has quickly risen through the ranks there and has gotten himself a nice promotion that has expanded his responsibilities to a national, rather than regional, level. Chris is one of the friendliest and most genuine guys I have met in the cigar business. One of the great things about being friends with Chris is that he is a very knowledgeable and passionate cigar guy with an insider's knowledge of the industry so he is full of great stories about cigars and the cigar business. He once relayed to me the story of the Perdomo family which is a truly amazing story. Here is a brief synopsis of what Chris told me. You can also find a more detailed version of the story on the Perdomo website.The Perdomo family story has all the makings of an excellent A&E Biography or perhaps a great made for TV movie. The two Patriarchs of the family endured a lot on their road to success in the cigar industry. In Cuba, both Silvio Perdomo and his son, Nick Sr., were making names for themselves as master craftsman in the Cuban cigar industry. Then in the midst of all this success their worlds were turned upside down by the Communist Revolution and Castro's rise to power. Both were and are peaceful opposers of the Communist rule in Cuba. As a result, Silvio Perdomo was arrested and jailed. He endured 12 years of torture and mistreatment. The whole time he was imprisoned he refused to compromise his beliefs, never once conceding to demands that he show public support of Castro and the Communist party. Silvio's son Nick Sr. almost lost his life because of the family's anti-communist views. He was shot and critically wounded by communist guerrillas. Close friends of the family hid Nick and cared for his wounds. Before he could fully recover from his gunshot wounds friends were able to sneak him out of the country bringing Nick Sr. to the United States. Eventually Silvio was freed as well and rejoined his son in Miami. The two began making cigars again in their Kitchen and it wasn't long before Nick's son, Nick Jr., joined the family business. Now, from those modest beginnings the Perdomo family cigar business has a location in Miami and a huge factory in Esteli, Nicaragua.That's the short version of the story of Tabacalera Perdomo and the Edici\u00f3n de Silvio line of cigars. Nick Jr. created the Perdomo Edici\u00f3n de Silvio as a living tribute to his late grandfather and mentor. The ultra premium selection of tobaccos that go into the blends of this line are a closely guarded secret known only to members of the Perdomo family. You can enjoy an Edici\u00f3n de Silvio in one of three wrappers. It comes in either a Natural, Maduro, or an exquisite (I speak from personal experience) genuine African Cameroon wrapper. There are six different vitolas available which are rolled exclusively by the factories five most skilled rollers. They are the Robusto, Toro, Petite Corona, No.2 Torpedo, Double Corona, and a monstrous Salomon.

It quickly mellowed delivering a rich creamy flavor of toasted nuts. Further in the flavors changed to a pleasant spice with a slightly citrus undertone and a woody finish.

These are one of my all time favourite cigars. Yet I still prefer the Rosado Red wrapper on a regular Opus. In any case, I tend to think of maduros in general, as a bit of a scam. Why? Because real maduros are very very rare. 95% of maduros just have a cooked(heat applied to wrapper leaf) or even a dyed wrapper. Also, since the wrapper leaf is heat treated, maduro cigars are poor candidates for long term aging, as the wrapper leaf will not continue to improve in flavor over time. In Cuba, there are no \u201cfake maduros.\u201d Cuban maduros are made from the most mature, and naturally darker, tobacco leaves. For an excellent Padron, try the \u201964 series Monarch in Natural!

The pressure to release a new cigar every year can lead to compromises in quality, and personally I think it\u2019s best when a company puts in as much time as it needs to in order to make something really excellent.  At the time of its releae at 2014 IPCPR, the Illusione Fume d'Amour was the first new cigar line from this brand in three years, which makes it a very exciting release.The name Fume d'Amour uses French words but according to a friend it doesn't really make sense to French ears (it should have rather been called fum\u00e9e d'amour). I guess it could be translated to \"love smoke\" or \"to love to smoke\".  It\u2019s a Nicaraguan puro manufactured at the TABSA Factory in Jalapa.  As a matter of interest, no ligero leaves were used in its construction, only seco and viso leaves.  It\u2019s available in four sizes: Lagunas (4.5 x 42), Clementes (6.5 x 48), Viejos (5 x 50), and Capristanos (6 x 56).  For this review, I smoked the Viejos.Appearance :  The Illusione Fume d'Amour is a lovely stick to look at with a wrapper the color of milk chocolate.  Oil adds a sheen and there are a few large veins and a number of small ones.  The triple cap is perfect and the wrapper is smooth to the touch.  The band is all right, but isn\u2019t particularly eye-catching.  The letters are very small and not the easiest to read.Construction :  There is nothing whatsoever to complain about here!  The draw is perfect right from the start and stays that way, and so does the burn, which was razor sharp.  I did have to make a couple of minor adjustments, but nothing outside the norm.  The ash was firm and built up nicely without much flaking, medium gray in color.Flavor :  The appearance and construction of this cigar are matched by its wonderful flavors.  There is a lot of complexity here.  You start out with sweet nuts, red pepper, cocoa, and an undercurrent of cream.  There\u2019s a lot of sweetness and just a dash of salt, and also a hint of citrus, perhaps lemon.  The flavors only continue to build through the first third.  Cedar enters, followed cinnamon and something like pastry, and then a floral note.  Caramel has also come out to play.  During the second third, the red pepper becomes more prominent and so does the sweetness, balancing it out perfectly.  In the final third, the most prominent flavors are coffee, cream, red pepper, cocoa, nuts and that floral note I can\u2019t identify.  Cedar also becomes more expressive.Essentially there is a slow build in flavors during the first third, and then during the second and final third, those flavors trade places, emerging and submerging, but no new flavors present themselves.Value :  I\u2019ve seen a price range for this stogie; at the lower end you can buy the Illusione Fume d'Amour for around $6.50, and at the upper end you\u2019ll pay closer to $9.50.

So to begin this review I am going to relay a short holiday story regarding this cigar.  If this is something you wish to bypass, by all means do and just skip to the second paragraph.  I will think no less of you and neither will the cigar.  Having spent slightly more than the past year of my life married to my wonderful wife, I find, like many of you, that sometimes it requires a little bit of circus talent to juggle everything going on.  As my wife and my families live about 2.5 hours apart, we both agreed that trying to make it to both Christmases every year would end up causing more stress than needed.  To compromise, we alternate visiting one side of the family for Christmas and the other on Thanksgiving and New Years.  This year was the first Christmas that we spent with her family.  Everyone had a great time and I felt extremely welcome, as always, but certain holiday traditions and feelings associated with your own family on Christmas are almost impossible to recreate elsewhere.  Fast forward to our arrival at my parents\u2019 house for our pseudo Christmas celebration on New Years.  It was joyous and you could tell that the family was happy to be together after being apart.  After a hearty meal, with my wife and mother both asleep on the couches, my father and I decided to have a smoke.  I brought him a Tatuaje J21, which he greatly enjoyed; although probably not as much as the one from my prior review.  For myself I decided to try out the Carlos Torano Exodus 1959 50 Year Anniversary Short Churchill.From the very first viewing I find this cigar to be a prime example of both beauty and fine construction.  An extremely dark maduro wrapper is rolled almost seamlessly.  There are some veins but none of them appears daunting.  The very intricate band is so well printed that it mimes genuine stamped copper.  The various crests add elegant accents without becoming overly gaudy.  When gently pinching the barrel it is very firm throughout with only slight give and no noticeably soft spots.  Faint musty odors come from it with earth and cedar tones predominant.The first puff of this solid feeling cigar exudes bountiful levels of smoke.  Accompanying flavors are of pepper and earth, both of which are full flavored but not overwhelming.  A sharp burn leaves behind tight, light gray ash indicating that the construction goes beyond surface deep.  After a short while, a caramel hint joins the others providing a very nice balance.  Surprisingly, besides the fact that all of the construction appears flawless, the ash only holds on for about one-half of an inch prior to dropping off.  It is not flakey or loose but still holds tight so it may have just been a slight irregularity.Throughout the entire first third, the smell coming off the foot is remarkable.  Caramel seems to be most dominant and the previously mentioned pepper is evident as a mild tingle in the nose.  At about one third in the pepper increases and is accompanied by a very strong tobacco.  The ash holds on longer this time reaching about the halfway point.  A simple spiced cinnamon is accentuated after ashing and continues into the latter half.  One other note that comes through in the final half is a faint cherry flavor, which was surprising because in past experiences if cherry is present it usually crops up around the start of most cigars.All in all, this is one tantalizing cigar.  The bold pepper, spice and earth baseline provides the perfect palette for accentuating those caramel and cherry notes.  On top of this, the cigar holds a sharp burn through and through, requiring little to no fuss beyond an occasional rotation.  At 5 to 6 dollars this is a cigar that everyone should try at least once and could easily find a permanent spot in a daily rotation.  Purchase without worry because even if you do pick up a few and find them not quite to your personal tastes, the 50 year edition is gorgeous enough to make an attractive gift.

There was the West Coast version, the No. 1 Lado Occidental, and the East Coast\u2019s No. 2 Zona del Este. Each was sold in cabinets of 50 cigars. They were a huge hit and remain a favorite of many Tatuaje fans. They were a limited release however, and much to the dismay of those fans, they are no longer made and extremely hard to find and generally unavailable. If you don\u2019t already have some you aren\u2019t likely to get any. But despair not, there have been subsequent releases of the Verocu blend like the No.9 which is a Holts exclusive. The most recent addition to the line is the Verocu Tubos, a tubed Torpedo measuring an ample six and one eighth inches in length and sporting a beefy 52 ring gauge. It comes armored in a very nice, bright red aluminum tube and is available in boxes of 10.This torpedo is not a particularly pretty cigar but not ugly or rustic either.  The wrapper is dark, mottled, and slightly veiny.  It is well filled with no soft spots and smells of cedar and leather.  The draw is a little on the loose side but not too much so.  The first draw has a predictable peppery bite to it before settling in to a spicy, earthy core with complimentary notes of cedar, leather, and tobacco which seem to come and go as I made my way through the smoke.  The last third brought lots of earth and black pepper that over powered everything else and was a bit over the top even for me but didn\u2019t really detract much from the rest of the experience.  The Verocu Tubos is a fairly well-balanced, robust, and complex smoke with a sneaky bit of power to it.There has been lots of talk about cracked and split wrappers with this cigar.  I didn\u2019t have any of those problems but I did have several burn issues.  The cigar tunneled a bit at one point, then it started to canoe. It also went out on me three or four times.  These burn issues are very uncommon in my experiences with Tatuaje cigars.  Right now I am just going to chalk it all up to being a result of shipping conditions and I am hoping all that will work itself out with a few more months of rest in my humidor to acclimate and re-hydrate because the cigar did seem a touch dry to me.  Time will tell and I will probably wait another 6 months before I try another one to see where they are at.Overall I\u2019d say this was an excellent smoke with great body and good flavors.  If the burn issues do manage to work themselves out then I would rate this as an excellent cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

By far his name (and product) can be found in just about every cigar market in the United States.  However, today\u2019s review focuses on one of Patel\u2019s low-end production cigars.  The Rocky Patel R4 is a premium value line that differs from his normal line as the R4 is rolled in Nicaragua and not his typical Honduras factories.  The R4 line comes in bundles of 20 and is available in the following sizes:On to the review\u2026The Rocky Patel R4 had a very pleasing brown silky wrapper that contained plenty of veins and few blemishes.  The torpedo tip was somewhat lumpy on all three of my examples and the foot very nicely packed full of luscious tobacco.  What really caught my attention in this pre-light ritual was the awesome aroma the cigar profiled.  The beautiful rich chocolaty aroma made my mouth start to water.  The band was a simple plain brown with a sun/star in the middle, and was not applied evenly in the back.  Upon cutting I found the cold draw to be very tight, leaving me to cut ever more than usual from the tapered head.  Cold draw showed no true tasting notes.The opening of my Rocky Patel R4 Torpedo was very light and mild with no spice or power.  This cigar showed a nutty woodsy profile with minor lead/metallic notes in the first third.  The burn was somewhat wavy but nothing terrible.  Ash was a mixed grey and white and the aroma a sweet toasted tobacco.Moving into the second third the cigar still was safely in the mild range.  Still woody with an added cream/vanilla the tastes were certainly not overwhelming my palate.  The burn however had to be touched up twice and became quite inconsistent.  For some reason the cigar was having trouble staying lit.The final third of my Rocky Patel R4 had taste turning a bit darker and oaky with a dark cocoa tastes present.  The burn issues continued to persist and the ash was a dirty grey color.  Finally I just gave up because I was tired of keeping this cigar managed with the lighting.So overall for the price ($2.75) you can\u2019t complain about this smoke however do know you get what you pay for.  Expect to find flaws and inconsistencies, as this is a value line.  If you\u2019re a big fan of mild cigars I truly suggest giving these a shot.  This will be a great cigar for me when I\u2019m doing things like outside work (mowing the lawn) or other activities where I\u2019m not trying to totally focus on complex cigar profiles.  Do know though that this is not something I would reach for to hand out with the purpose of impressing dinner guest or great friends.Pre-Light: 7 pts. Smoking: 4 pts.

Enjoy!The Corona Nicaraguan Selection was introduced in 1997 and was Corona\u2019s first House Blend. They recently released a 10th Anniversary to commemorate the occasion. The original blend is hand-made in Central America under the care of Gilberto Oliva, Jr., a fifth generation Cuban master blender. The long filler in this blend is aged Cuban-seed grown in Nicaragua and is protected by a Panamanian Maduro wrapper.This is a gorgeous stick; the Maduro is very oily with no color variation, soft spots and very little veins to speak of. The pre-light aroma was excellent; a sweet and clean tobacco smell with hints of bitter chocolate and creamy caramel. The ash was a perfect white though it did \u201cv\u201d just a little bit. The flavor on this stick did not disappoint, with notes of bittersweet chocolate and creamy caramel, along with a very clean undertone of tobacco. There were no barnyard flavors to speak of, just a steady medium-roast flavor. There was some fairly heavy spike in the first third, but this eventually passed and was dominated by creaminess.Verdict: buy now! At around $2.40 per stick you cannot lose on this one. If you are a fan of Padron, 5 Vegas Original, or Sosa, this is a must try for a lower-priced alternative; you may not even know the difference!Two Thumbs Up!", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/corona-nicaraguan-selection.jpg?iv=16"}, "rocky patel fifteenth anniversary": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Torpedo Size : 6 1/8 x 52 Wrapper : Ecuador Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : $11 eachMore info about purchasing Rocky Patel 15th Anniversary cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "rocky patel", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["Nice review Kaleehb.

Starting as the Indian Tabac Cigar Company, Rocky Patel Premium Cigars has come to prove itself in the ever growing cigar industry.  The Fifteenth Anniversary series is rolled in Nicaragua at Tabacalera Villa Cuba, which Patel only partially owns.  The filler tobacco for these cigars is grown on a farm dedicated only to this brand and blend.The first thing I noticed about the Rocky Patel Fifteenth Anniversary was the impressive steel colored double bands the cigar bore.  The 15th Anniversary was box pressed with a wrapper that gave way to an elegant dark oily sheen.  The cap was a nice pointed tip and the pre-light smell gave hints of oak and bourbon with the cold draw being completely different, showing notes of cherry and vanilla.The first third of my Rocky Patel Fifteenth Anniversary produced a wonderfully sweet aroma with loads of gray smoke.  The first third danced between medium and full bodied with an uneven burn.  The taste was a very defined coffee with touches of light spice and chocolate.Into the second third of the cigar I had to touch the burn up however once fixed it wasn\u2019t an issue for the remainder of the smoking experience.  The cigar moved completely into the full body category with coffee notes becoming heavier and more intense.  The sweetness experienced in the first third was replaced by a charcoal/burnt flavor that tended to be bitter at times.The final third of the Rocky Patel Fifteenth Anniversary was spicy and heavy with dark coffee notes.  The ash was a beautiful wavy gray and the body remained full.  The finish on the cigar took an interesting turn to nutty and leathery characters that made for a satisfying finale.My final thoughts on the Rocky Patel Fifteenth Anniversary are respectable.  The cigar gave way to a perfect draw the entire time, was slow burning, and produced a lot of full bodied voluminous smoke.  The flavors/taste had minor changes throughout with the crescendo of spice and coffee from beginning to end.  Overall I think Rocky Patel cigars are certainly on the right track with most of their cigar lines.  I recommend giving this one a shot if you\u2019re looking for an intense full body, coffee smoking experience.Pre-Light: 9 pts. Smoking: 7 pts.

Be it mild Connecticut Shade or spicy Corojo, my taste runs the gamut of cigar flavor profiles.  But I am also a very picky cigar smoker. This can lead to exuberant exclamations of praise, or acts of vocal vilification. I\u2019m passionate about cigars and I\u2019m never at a loss of words when asked for my opinion. So, when we talked about reviewing cigars with Denis, I warned him upfront that anything could happen.  He was cool with that. Now that the disclaimer of out of the way, I can proceed with my review of the E.P. Carrillo New Wave Connecticut, Brillantes.When a cigar is golden-brown in color, it usually means it\u2019s wearing a shade-grown wrapper from Connecticut or Ecuador.  That delicate wrapper is mild in flavor and will often foreshadow a cigar of similar strength.  To some cigar smokers that is a bad thing.  We live in a time when stronger cigars are in vogue and there can be a prejudice against cigars of low intensity.  But these days, cigar makers have created some wonderful blends underneath the mild facade of the Connecticut Shade wrapper.  Unfortunately, the Carrillo New Wave Connecticut is not one of them.At first glance, the CNWC looks great.  With its nice golden color and smooth texture, this is an inviting cigar.  But upon ignition it quickly becomes clear that its beauty is only skin deep.I really wanted to like the CNWC.  I feel that mild cigars get a bum rap and I always root for the underdog.  But this stick had nothing going for it.  Of the two I had for review, I had to put the first one down before the mid-way point.  I found it tasteless with a sour finish.  To its credit it was not harsh, but the CNWC tasted more like paper than tobacco.  And its aroma resembled that of burnt leaves.  It was clear that this stick was doing nothing for the cause of the Connecticut Shade wrapper.But rather than judge prematurely, I waited a few days before smoking sample no. 2.  Man, that turned out to be a disaster!  Upon ignition, this second CNWC split its wrapper halfway down its length!  This was not good.  I knew that since the wrapper had split and pulled away from the binder, the blend would be ruined.  But smoked it I did\u2026 for about a half inch.  To have gone any further would have blown out my palate, and I wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.  Fool me once, blah, blah, blah.Cigar folks often use the term \u201cgood for its price\u201d.  To me, a cigar is either good or bad, and price has nothing to do with it.  It is true that some cigars seem over-priced while others can be terrific bargains, but to justify a ho-hum cigar by its price seems, to me, nonsensical.  At $5.00/stick, the CNWC might seem like such a cigar, if it were simply ho-hum.  But to pay anything for a cigar with no flavor and a sour finish is simply no bargain at all.But as I started out saying, I\u2019m a picky cigar smoker.  Perhaps there are some folks out there who enjoy the CNWC.  I mean them no disrespect.  We all have different tastes and expectations.  But to this smoker, I\u2019d rather smoke nothing at all than a cigar of which any price is too high.Flavors: Paper, burnt leaves X Factor: 0 Finish: Sour Strength: MildThis post was written by Robustojoe.

Enjoy!My vast knowledge of smoking a wide variety of cigars for about a whopping three years, certainly qualifies my AKA as el-cigar-newbie, and I do blog for the el-newbie nation. In this time line I have bought packs, samplers, bundles, mazos etc. As if that was not enough, three Humidors later, I joined the Cigar of the Month Club online at cigarsinternational.com. My love for cigars is growing, and getting more cigars at a bargain price is always appealing. Yesterday my monthly club sampler was delivered and the first cigar was randomly picked, cut and lit before looking at the cigar band. I just love surprises!\u201cThis beautifully oily cigar burns perfectly and draws like a dream. A cigar that feels solid in the hand and is well constructed. It is on the full side of medium bodied and spactular. It features a nice spice for aficionados who prefer a fuller experience.\u201d (villigercigars.com).\u201c\u2026pronounced notes of dark chocolate, earth, and wood.\u201d (excerpt taken from Cigars International The Tobacco Leaf).The Villiger Colorado lived up to most of the hype. Normally I do not pay much attention to the listed flavor profiles of cigars because honestly, if a cigar tastes good to me, as far as I am concerned the cigar is a keeper! Up until yesterday, cigar's flavor profile that I have smoked never came through to me, except the Villiger Colorado. It was not oily because of the recent shipment which some humidor time will revive, the burn was clean and the draw very smooth, until I could not fingertip it anymore. Very well wrapped and the 54 gauge complimented the rest of the Villiger Colorado cigar. When I smelled the smoke of the lit foot it was that of chocolate! I actually smelled chocolate! Then my tongue tasted the hint of sweet, it was an awesome first experience for me, and the fullness went consistently with the smoke and others flavors. Now, being truthful, wood and earth are not on my menu so there is nothing to report in that flavor profile area.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/villiger-colorado.jpg?iv=16"}, "cusano cuvee rouge": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Toro Gordo Size : 6 x 54 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Sun Grown Filler : Ecuador and Dominican Binder : ?

We had to take this target in. After he found out we were on his trail, he went into hiding and underwent plastic surgery - he thought we had lost him; he was wrong. Joining me on this mission is my trusty partner in Spydom, Agent G. Together we tracked the target to an inconspicuous walk-in humidor in Monona, Wisconsin. There we apprehended the target and used our ancient methods of interrogation on him.Wow! The heavens have opened up today! Good thing I own an Ark. Parking is a real pain however. Also, it\u2019s a good thing that today is cigar review day and we\u2019re inside our friendly Tasting Room. So, let it rain as I am content to decompress with a good cigar and good company.It was my assignment this week to select our \u201cstick du jour\u201d. Agent 10 threw me that curve ball earlier in the week. Rising to the challenge, I consulted my favorite stick guru, artist in residence and all around good guy, Kevin. He didn\u2019t hesitate a beat, smiled and said, \u201cwhy, I have just the stick\u201d. The Cusano Cuvee Rouge! He had just rediscovered them, as they had been resting for about 10 months now, and thought it was worth the wait. Assignment complete, all before Agent 10 arrived and still time to crack a brew! Sweet! (an Abby Ale).My experience with Cusano was limited to the \u201c18\u201d, which I had enjoyed in the past, but it has been well over a year. So I was looking forward to trying the Cusano line again.The wrapper was dark, with mild vein structure and didn\u2019t look to oily. To the touch it was firm with just a tad more sponge toward the foot. The dry draw was fairly easy. Overall this construction was good. It lit quickly and continued to draw smoothly. Ah, mild. Nice. A slight, very slight, wood. No aftertaste on the back of the palate. Just the way I like it after lunch.This held consistent through three quarters of the cigar. It burned evenly and the ash broke off in that nice cone into the tray. Yes, a good cigar for me. The only downside was I needed to relight twice and after the second time it started to turn a little bitter on me. All done.I would certainly recommend this stick and I will go back to it .Well, it stopped raining and it was time to get the ark back to the marina before Noah missed it!Ciao!Appearence/Construction: I began interrogation with my usual sizing up of the target. He had a uniform light-med brown wrapper, and a well placed cap that was indistinguishable from the rest of the cigar. His surgery had gone well. I poked and prodded him for a little information. He was evenly filled with no hard or soft spots - save for a slight spongyness at the foot; I found his week spot. I decided to start there with our usual interrogation method: answers by fire.Flavors: I thought our interrogation was working; a subtle woodiness was noticed in the slightly sweet tobacco flavor. This target, however, was stubborn to the end. Interrogation lasted for over an hour and a half - still no new information. As my partner mentioned, the target became bitter and harsh towards the end. When we knew he was of no use to us anymore.Evaluation and Termination: Overall, this target was not the most exciting target I have ever interrogated. While it was a pleasant smoke, it offered no complexity, and no interesting flavors. I\u2019d say keep your money, and skip this target.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents. Click here for their latest articles and more information.

Since its launch in the beginning of 2013, the Cult brand has been earning mixed reviews from cigar lovers all over the world. The Cult Ometepe is swaddled in a dark, ruddy colored Ecuadorian Habano leaf. The wrapper leaf is veiny and rough, giving the Ometepe a desultory look. The five-and-a-half inch long stick is banded with a drab brown and white \u201cCult\u201d band. All in all, the Cult Ometepe is not a stick that would catch my attention on the shelf of a brick and mortar.What makes the Ometepe stand out from the crowd is on the inside; underneath the shoddy looking wrapper and bromidic band. The binder and long-leaf filler are grown on the island of Ometepe in Lake Nicaragua. This tiny, hourglass shaped island was formed by two volcanoes, Concepcion and Maderas. The volcanic activity on the island has left behind incredibly fertile soil, perfect for growing tobacco and the Cult Ometepe is stuffed with it. The length of the large Robusto is plump and nicely filled. The cap is thin but squarely mounted.The pre-light aroma from the wrapper is a faint and sweet while the foot is rich and toasty with notes of black cherry and nuts. The cold draw is mild and nutty. Once lit, the first few puffs are full of red pepper and a slightly ashy flavor. The ashy flavor ebbs quickly while pungent flavors of peanuts and toasted wheat take center stage. A honeyed sweetness begins to peak through at the end of the second third and is in full swing by the second third. Earthy notes of cedar and leather push their way though midway through the second third. The final third is dominated by dark flavors of smoked hickory, leather, and rich tobacco.Cult\u2019s Ometepe Grande Robusto draws nicely, producing large plumes of thick, rich smoke with each puff. The dark gray ash is strong and compact, growing to almost two inches before the first drop. The burn is slow and even. The ash drops a total of three times during the eighty-four minute smoke.The Cult Ometepe is a surprisingly rich, complex smoke. I am embarrassed to admit that, left to my own devices; I would have avoided smoking this stick simply because of the name (Cult\u2026 who names a brand \u201cCult?\u201d It\u2019s just silly and downright presumptuous!) and appearance. Despite all of that, the Ometepe is a delightful smoke and definitely worth a try.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com.

Most everyone who is into cigars knows that every year Avo releases a Limited Edition cigar to celebrate Mr. Avo Uvezian\u2019s birthday.   Last year in April of 2009 I had the honor of attending one of his many birthday parties.  Even at 83 Mr.U is still touring the country celebrating his birthday with his fans.  At this celebration I picked up a box of the LE09\u2032s [l-ee-oh-nines] as they are also known as.Mr U was gracious enough to sign the box for me.  The party was a lot of fun and many great cigars were smoked, the greatest of which was the Compa\u00f1ero.  I decided that night that the LE09 would become my son\u2019s birthday cigar\u2026  that is, it would be the cigar I smoked to celebrate my son\u2019s birthday in April each year until my box was gone (there are 10 cigars in a box).  As it turned out, I was sick this year for my son\u2019s birthday so I decided to hold off and smoke the cigar to celebrate both his and my birthday, which happens to be today.  So Happy Birthday to me.It is a handsome cigar with a dark wrapper and a good draw.  It starts off with a blast of pepper followed up by earth, leather, and spice.  Easily the most robust Avo I have ever smoked, it does mellow a little as you near the second third of the cigar and develops notes of coffee and cream and a bit of  wood/cedar.  There is also a subtle sweetness now that may have been hidden by that initial onslaught of rich and peppery flavors.  In the last third it really picks up again with lots of leather and earth and it finally starts to exhibit that tell-tale Kelner mustiness that is often associated with Avo cigars. It has a bit of pepper on the finish at this point as well.The Compa\u00f1ero is a great smoke and easily my favorite Avo of them all.  I look forward to next April when I smoke my next one.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Carlos Garcia Pereda is the master blender for Elogio, and he is the grandson of legendary Cuban tobacco grower and cigar maker, Alejandro Robaina.  Carlos learned his trait in the Pinar del Rio region which can be considered one of the best of Cuba.  The Elogio Serie Habano has tobacco from the Condega, Jalapa, and Somoto regions of Nicaragua.  The cigar comes in several sizes:  a 7 x 48 Churchill; a 5 x 50 Robusto; a 6 x 42 Corona Extra; a 5 x 32 Petite Corona; and the featured 6.13 x 52 Torpedo.Appearance :  The cigar has a very nice dark brown color.  It does appear that the cigar has some veins to it, but not enough to raise a concern.  The cigar seems soft; yet, no oily sheen is observed.The wrapper had a barnyard smell which was not very overpowering.  The foot had more pronounced barnyard/earthy notes to it.The band has the name \u201cElogio\u201d written in script font at the front of the cigar.  A smaller \u201cHand Made Nicaragua\u201d is written below.  The background is gold with a red trim on one side, and a green trim on the other.  Two lines that form what looks like a V come out of each side of the cigar.  A red V is seen on the green trim while a green V is seen on the red trim.Construction :  The cigar does not seem to show any soft spots, and it is very firm to the touch.  It is a very pleasant cigar in the hands; the wrapper does not appear to have any imperfections.  The cap seems to be composed of two wrapper leaves.The pre-light draw is a bit restricted.  This tight draw continued after the cigar was lit. The draw improved significantly after about an inch of ash was tapped off the cigar.The band was removed pretty easily; no glue marks were left behind in the cigar.The cigar produced a very tight white ash on the outside while the inside was charcoal grey; the Elogio burned very evenly.Flavor :  The cigar was cut using a Palio guillotine cutter.  For a variation, I used the Joe Dickman cut on the torpedo.  Instead of a straight cut, the cutter was turned about 45 degrees.  The purpose of this type of cut is to give the cigar smoker more of a surface area to draw and experience the flavors of the cigar.The pre-light taste was nice and spicy on the tongue.  The initial draw (after lighting) had a spicy and leathery taste.The retrohale had hints of roasted nuts and espresso coffee beans.About halfway thorough the cigar, it became bitter with a metallic/chemical taste developing.  The cigar was purged which seemed to remove the bitterness, and it seemed to remove the off flavors.Flavors seemed to have gotten stronger during the second half.  The roasted nut flavor was noticeably dominant; the cigar also got smokier during the second half.Value :  Considering this is a torpedo-shaped cigar the price tag is not bad for what one gets ($6.20/stick).

Fortunately for us, a couple we are friends with partook heartily and ended up purchasing the entire twenty-eight disk box set.  Borrowing it from our friends, the two of us proceeded to follow the crime boss cigar enthusiast, Tony Soprano, through six seasons all the way to the infamous cut to black and we both agreed that the show was slated to reside on our top five series list for some time.  A short time after the roller-coaster\u2019s conclusion, a fellow BOTL and I participated in a blind trade and the CAO Sopranos Boss was one of the cigars included from his end.  Not having known that these cigars even existed, I was very excited to sample the smoke that CAO deemed fitting to represent big boss Soprano himself.On inspection, the barrel of this cigar is incredibly solid.  There is almost no give to it despite having been kept at 70%Rh for a couple of months.  A dark mocha colored wrapper of fantastic construction seamlessly sheaths the cigar.  There are minimal veins although a toothy texture exists throughout.  Removing my Palio cutter from its sheath I proceed to cut the cap of the cigar.  Not having smoked many torpedo shaped cigars, I heed the advice of a more experienced BOTL and cut the cigar at an angle in order to allow a less restrictive flow and reduce tar buildup.  Unfortunately, my inexperience shows itself and I misjudge the cut, removing more than desired.  The draw is still firm so the smoke is mostly unaffected.Setting fire to the foot produces voluminous dense smoke.  An enjoyably smooth flavor is backed by a slightly citrus undertone. The citrus fades into a thicker presence akin to soft custard.  It is quite interesting and very pleasant.  Having been very excited to see several BOTL\u2019s come away without ashing this one a single time, I am somewhat disappointed by the loose white ash that the ragged burn leaves behind.  It is solid enough to clearly show the original tooth of the wrapper but not able to hold on for very long.Moving into the second third develops a cocoa and coffee combination with some nuttiness.  After a few more puffs the nut flavor distinguishes itself as hazelnut that, when coupled with the thick smoke and coffee, tastes almost like a hazelnut latte.  Retrohaling through the nose typically accentuates the strongest/harshest flavors of the cigar for me but with this one, the bitter espresso that comes through is very enjoyable.Overall this smoke is quite delightful.  The subtle flavors that come about throughout its length are very well balanced and keep you guessing where they are heading next.  The construction looks beautifully carried out but the irregularity of the burn and loose ash cause it to fall a few points.  Coming in at about $12 dollars a piece, I would like to be able to worry less about the ash and focus more on the flavor but the CAO Sopranos does, however, prove itself as being more than just a name.  I say try it once and second time if you are on the fence.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (3.75)This post was written by Joe K.

Now, I think I completely missunderstood the CAO Brazilia which is getting good reviews all around the cigar blogosphere (you might also want to check out the guest review by Cory of the CAO Brazilia Gol! here at Cigar Inspector). Somehow, I found it quite tasteless and disappointing.Appearance :  I had the Lambada vitola for this review which is a standard 6 x 50 Toro. The dark Brazilian wrapper looks really good and smells of chocolate (among other scents). Of course, the band makes me think about Rio de Janeiro beaches, the carnaval and the 1994 World Cup in the USA which was the first one I watched (I'm still quite young, you know).\u00a0 Construction :  Unlike the Italia, the construction on this stick was impeccable. The Lambada was regularly packed, was very easy to cut & light and it smoked beautifully.Flavor :  The flavor, on the other hand, completely disappointed me. It was bland and grassy with occasional coffee notes. I felt no real evolution and the smoke left my mouth very dry. I put it off in the beginning of the last third.Value :  I will wait a little bit before buying any more CAO cigars except, perhaps, the LX2/MX2 series.Overall Rating :  I heard rumors that the blend for Brazilias has been changed. If this is true (can anyone confirm?), then I can understand that I didn't like this cigar as much as others (who reviewed the cigar much earlier than me).This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Located in Columbus, Ohio (go Buckeyes [sorry Michigan fans]), NHC is my kind of store.  The owners are hardcore cigar nuts that believe Cuba no longer makes the best cigars.  I couldn\u2019t agree more (see my article about this here), and I rely on NHC as a source for great, non-Cuban, boutique cigars.At the epicenter of this new cigar-paradigm lies Esteli, Nicaragua.  It is the birthplace of many new brands, some of which have emerged as leaders of this cigar renaissance.  Surrounded by rich volcanic soil, Esteli produces some of the strongest and most flavorful cigar tobacco on the planet.  With its close proximity to other, great tobacco growing regions, i.e. Condega and Jalapa, it\u2019s no wonder why many of the best boutique cigar makers have made this part of the world their home.  Over the past six or seven years, an astounding number of great cigars have come out of this region: Tatuaje, My Father, and Casa Fernandez, to name just a few.  Although many cigar vendors sell these brands, the owners of NHC understand the value of featuring only stellar boutique brands.  A glance at their website illustrates this concept.  If your tastes lean towards the traditional Romeo y Julieta or Cohiba, this is not the place for you.  NHC has a simple concept: to provide the intimacy of a small cigar store to its online customers.  They don\u2019t warehouse huge quantities of cigars, and ship all orders vacuum packed, with humidification.  (I\u2019ve smoked their cigars right out of the package and they taste perfectly conditioned.)  But the best part of their service is their ability to always have new, cutting edge cigars available to smoke.  For a critical cigar aficionado, this is a real selling point.After years of buying cigars from a particular vendor, we get a \u201cfeel\u201d for a store\u2019s sensibilities.  Everyone has their own particular tastes, and finding a cigar dealer who shares our sensibilities can be a valuable asset.  By trusting the recommendations of those we know we will have a greater chance of finding a cigar we like, sight-unseen.  The trick is to be in the loop when new product becomes available.  That is where the Internet really helps.  By subscribing to newsletters, we can get regular announcements from our favorite vendors.  This is how I became aware of an outstanding and unique cigar called Skull and Bones.  Last year, NHC offered this limited production cigar, and I trusted their judgment. Frankly, I try many of the new cigars they carry.  I don\u2019t always love their stuff, but all have been worth exploring.  But with the Skull and Bones, they were really on to something.  Made by Andre Farkas of Viaje, these cigars were rich and earthy, offset by a sweet spice.  Almost black in color, the Skull and Bones was a maduro of intense character.  But this was a very limited run and after I smoked through my stash, sadly, no more were available.  So, when NHC announced that they had developed a new cigar that looked, on the surface, to be similar, I was very excited.The Surrogates Bone Crusher had the look and vibe of the Skull and Bones.  The ominous name, dark wrapper, and stout dimensions, were all reminiscent of the cigar I was looking for.  And the good news was that it was an ongoing production, not a limited run like the Skull and Bones.  But, the proof was in the pudding so I bought a sampler first.Right away I could see this cigar had promise.  Its pre-lit taste had that molasses spiciness, reminiscent of the Skull and Bones.  But upon lighting I could sense a touch of citrus, a flavor I could not associate with the Skull and Bones.  Additionally, the Bone Crusher starts out more mild than the Skull and Bones.  Yet other similarities remained.  Both editions had great tobacco richness, licorice tones, and super smoothness to the nub.  With perfect balance, neither had excessive spice.But what exactly was the Surrogates Bone Crusher?   The NHC website gave no information as to its origins.  Was it indeed an extension of the Skull and Bones?  Is that why they called it Surrogates?  I had to know and promptly emailed NHC.  Here\u2019s what Dan of NHC wrote in response:Surrogates have NOTHING to do with Skull and Bones or Viaje.  They are made by My Father Cigars and were blended by Pete Johnson. [] Starting off as a social experiment, to see if people would embrace a limited release quality stick at an everyday price, it has expanded to include 2 new sticks on the horizon as Surrogates will be marketed by L\u2019Atelier Imports, Pete\u2019s new company with myself, K.C. Johnson and Sean \u201cCasper\u201d Johnson.  The original Bone Crusher and Skull Breaker will be joined by 2 new vitolas, each with its own blend.  Tramp Stamp is a 5 1/4 x 48 vitola blended as a take off on the Tatuaje Black label and Crystal Baller is a 5 3/4 x 56 box press blended for flavor that still has a medium-full body.  Both will premiere at the IPCPR show in August alongside the Bone Crusher and Skull Breaker vitolas.   Pete and I wanted to take these national and the L\u2019Atelier umbrella seemed like the perfect place to do so.Although I was sure the Bone Crusher was an extension of the Skull and Bones line, turns out I was very wrong, but not disappointed.  (To be clear, the Surrogates is an exclusive NHC brand, while the Skull and Bones was nationally distributed.)  The Surrogates Bone Crusher is a great cigar with a great draw, tons of rich smoke, perfect burn, and great natural Habano flavor.  It was nice to find a maduro-colored cigar that didn\u2019t taste flavored.  Of moderate complexity, the Surrogates Bone Crusher is a blend of Nicaraguan fillers with a Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper.  This really surprised me.  My association with Connecticut leaf was always that of a mild, shade-grown claro (golden color) wrapper.  This rich, dark brown cigar really had me fooled.  But that could explain the Surrogates\u2019 medium strength. It starts out pretty tame, with its power kicking in near the end.  But the best thing about the Surrogates Bone Crusher is that it leaves an impression.  It\u2019s a cigar that wants to be smoked again and again.  It\u2019s got a ton of X Factor.Honestly, I\u2019m not sure why NHC chose to introduce the Bone Crusher in this manner.  It certainly was confusing.  Pete Johnson and My Father Cigars are arguably the hottest names on the cigar scene today; why not use this to promote the Surrogates?  (Although I must admit it was fun to guess its origins.)  Perhaps NHC was tapping into its customers\u2019 innate curiosity about cigars.  In my case, it totally worked.  Actually, with the flood of product coming from Pete and My Father, I might otherwise have passed on this one.Making a great cigar is very difficult.  To be successful all the elements of production need to be perfect.  From agronomy to construction, a cigar is only as good as its weakest link in the production chain.  But when great growers and blenders put their talents together, great things happen.  In the case of the Surrogates Bone Crusher, everything seems to have fallen into place.   To make a cigar in the image of the folks at NHC, only the best elements were chosen.  These guys know great cigars, and their experience and taste has guided them to perfection.  The trend of cigar vendors collaborating with cigar makers is not new, and has become standard practice within the industry.  Through this marriage, many great new cigar brands have been born, and at bargain prices.  But when a boutique vendor hooks up with a boutique manufacturer, the end result can be truly exceptional.  Such is the case with the Bone Crusher.  It\u2019s a cigar I can\u2019t put down, and when available at $6/stick, there is no reason to do so.Flavors: Molasses, licorice, lemon, honey X Factor: 9.4 Finish: Light and pleasant Strength: MediumThis post was written by Robustojoe.

Upmann Sun Grown cigars...My very good friend and drinking buddy, Rob Garrison (Territory Manager - Altadis U.S.A.), recently gave me a new release from one of their premium brands, the H. Upmann - Sun Grown.  The Sun Grown was debuted at the 2010 IPCR and is currently making its way onto Tobacconist's shelves.  It is made in Honduras at the La Flor de Copan cigar factory and is being released in six vitolas: Churchill - 54 x 7, Magnum - 54 x 6, Short Churchill - 54 x 4-1/2, No. 2 - 52 x 6-1/8, Corona - 44 x 5-1/2, and Lancero - 40 x 7-1/2.  It is made with an Equadorian sun grown capa, a Connecticut broadleaf capote, and a Nicaraguan and Honduran blend tripa; ranging in price roughly between $6 - $8.  For this review I smoked the Magnum and No. 2.The Sun Grown's capa had a few veins which gave it a good look and was smooth to the touch with a color I put somewhere between colorado maduro and maduro.  It squeezed nicely and was very firm, perhaps a little stiff in places but nothing of concern and there were no soft spots or visible flaws.  The foot revealed what appeared to be a well packed cigar, which I certainly like and explains the firmness of the squeeze.  The pre-light aroma was mild to moderate and very sweet and pleasant.  I made a straight cut with a double guillotine and tested the pre-light taste and draw.  The taste was sweet like the aroma and woody, while the draw gave decent resistance while being very smooth.  Using a match it took a little bit to light, due to the ring gauge and apparent good pack, but once lit was very even.The Sun Grown started off with a little bit of spice on the tongue and retro-exhalation was easy with some spice around mid-sinus.  It didn't produce much smoke until about 1/4\" to 1/2\" in leaving behind a light grey ash with dark rings.  The spice essentially subsided early on and relatively mild woody flavor notes took over.  A little past 1\" in a taste developed at the back of the throat which I couldn't really put my finger on and no other flavors jumped out or dominated through the first 1/3.  The ash dropped off at about 1-3/4\" and shortly afterward I began to detect leathery notes that lingered pleasantly after each puff.  From then on through the final 1/3, wood and leather was the consistent flavor with a bit more spice emerging again in the last 2\".  Throughout the entire smoke the burn was very even and never required a touch-up or re-light.All in all the H. Upmann - Sun Grown was a pleasant, enjoyable smoke.  Fans of medium body cigars I think will certainly like it.  The sweetness of the aroma was one of my favorite aspects of this cigar and because of its over-all mellowness, it makes a good mid-day choice.  It is also a good choice for relaxing alone or with friends because you don't have to devote your attention to a complex flavor profile.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/images/cigar/h-upmann-sun-grown.jpg"}, "tatuaje the drac": {"origin": "Origin : Miami, FL Format : Torpedo Size : 6 3/4 x 52 Wrapper : Nicaraguan Habano Maduro Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$13 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "tatuaje", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["If you need to display your ciars with fangs, in a coffin, and with a witty name\u2026how good  could they be?

One of this year's releases, and the subject of this review, is the Drac-2009.  Before I go any further, let me address some major issues which have surrounded this cigar.  The Dracs were shipped in painted and lacquered, coffin shaped boxes which have been at the root of the primary complaint.  There have been numerous complaints about a terrible odor emanating from the box and even some about that odor and even a flavor having been imparted to the cigars themselves. The Drac is a Halloween themed cigar which of course, had to be released by 31 October, but according to Pete Johnson the box maker in Nicaragua wasn't able to complete the boxes until shortly before the release date.  This resulted in the boxes not having time to air out before they were packed, wrapped in cellophane, and ultimately shipped.  When opened by B&Ms or individual buyers at their final destination, the trapped odor from the paint and lacquer has poured out.  The second complaint about these cigars is that many of the wrappers were damaged when the boxes were opened and the cigars were still \"wet.\"For the first problem, Pete recommends that you remove the cigars from their original box and place them in your humidor to rest and age for a while.  If you want to keep the box, let it air out for a few weeks and he says it should be fine.  This is why I'm reviewing a Halloween themed cigar now.  For the second problem, he says if you have any damaged cigars, return them to Tatuaje in an uncut, unlit, unsmoked fashion and they will replace them.  I have heard some people say that they think the Dracs were released too soon and the moist tripa expanded causing the capa to \"burst.\"  Who can say for sure, but Pete says they were intact when they were shipped and each of the ones I smoked for this review had none of the reported bad smell or damage.  I also checked with one of the top B&Ms in my area and they said they had heard of these problems but had not experienced them.  There is an in depth explanation on the Tatuaje website of what I just reiterated, so on to the smoke.The Drac was released in a 6-3/4 x 52 \"fang-shaped\" Torpedo vitolla, in 1,300 boxes of 13 cigars each with a recommended price of $13 per cigar (before taxes and other penalties of course).  There were also a certain number of \"Spooky Tickets\" placed in various boxes, the finders winning something from Tatuaje (reminiscent of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory).  The Drac is a Nicaraguan puro with a Habano maduro capa which was perhaps just a shade below maduro in color with no real visible flaws.  It was adorned with a simple black and red band at the foot, had a smooth texture with some nice veins but felt very light in the hand.  The squeeze test was a bit odd; it seemed to give too much close beneath the capa and didn't firm up until under pressure.  These could all be signs of poor packing, but I'm not certain this is the case here and that would definitely be out of character for Tatuaje.  The pre-light aroma was very mild with the slightest hint of sweetness but no real perceptible notes.  I made a straight cut with a single guillotine which the head stood up to without fraying.  The reason I mention this is because a single guillotine only cuts from one side and exerts pressure from the other which can easily cause damage, so this was sort of a quality test.  The pre-light draw was easy and had a slight woody taste, following which it lit easily and evenly and produced a good amount of grey smoke from the draw.Initially there was a mild woody taste and a hint of bitterness on the middle-top of the tongue which went away quickly.   The tiniest spice tingle snuck up on the tip of the tongue about 1/4\" into it and retro-exhalation was a bit harsh but could be done very gently.  As it smoked it produced a light-grey ash with hints of dark undertones which was soft and a little crisp and had an interesting 'rippled' appearance to it which held on for the whole first 1/3.  Up to this point it burned well but required its first touch-up about 1-1/2\" in.  Into the middle 1/3 the ash became a little flaky and irregular and dropped off quickly.  A charred / burnt flavor would occasionally present itself but only briefly before passing.  Just past the half-way point it required a full re-light and bitterness became the dominant taste on the top of the tongue.  Through the final 1/3 it required minor touch-ups and couldn't shake the bitterness which ultimately took over the entire center of the tongue and lingered a while.I met Pete Johnson a couple years ago and liked him which is when he turned me onto his Cojonu cigar (but that is another review).  As I mentioned above, cigars with quality problems would certainly be out of character for Tatuaje and I am a fan of their smokes, but I have to give my honest opinion here, \"Puro Integritas.\"  Reputation is huge in this business and something like this can hurt a good company.  While they couldn't control the problems with the boxes, perhaps they should have bit the bullet and held on to them until next Halloween; the boxes wouldn't have been a problem and cigars get better with age.  Also, some of the problems others have reported, as well as the ones I experienced, could possibly indicate a \"wet\" cigar.  There is a time following a cigar's rolling known as, \"the period of sickness.\"  Some say it is only a myth, some say it is true, but the general consensus among believers is that from a few months up to a year after being rolled, a cigar may still be overly humidified from the tobacco being moistened prior to rolling.

I picked these up as a 5 pack from CigarMonster.com.Nose :  Not very strong but a nice mixture of light earthy tones, that delicious rich maduro scent with a slight sweet hay.Construction :  The wrapper has a nice rich, dark brown and slightly oily sheen to it.  There are veins present throughout, but none of them protrude at all.  No soft spots to be found anywhere, and only a slight and insignificant looseness at one point on the cap.  The band on this cigar is quite beautiful and well designed, and there's an additional band on the foot that gives it a classy look.Flavor :  I'm a big fan of maduro cigars, and after a week of travel without any opportunities to smoke I was really looking forward to this review.First Third:After toasting and lighting, my draws are immediately producing significant and satisfying quantities of rich smoke.  The first third produces quite a bit of pepper that lingers in the back of my throat, but isn't overpowering.  As I continue to smoke, the pepper intensity falls away to mix with a nice creamy tobacco taste.  As I progress I start to pick up light leather notes and what I could only describe as a cinnamon flavor.Second Third:The transition from first third to second third occurs naturally with no marked flavor changes.  The only additional flavor I pick up halfway through is a light note of molasses.  The pepper is never intense and is in great balance with the creaminess.  The two ebb and flow quite subtly throughout.Last Third:Again no sharp transitions here with flavor.  The tastes remain consistent until about halfway through the last third when the cigar naturally goes out on its own.  Had it not I would have been happy to smoke this all the way down.Burn / Draw :  The draw on this was absolutely effortless.  I had a nice even burn with reasonable ash production until I moved into the last third where I had to touch it up to keep going.  The Habano Maduro would likely benefit from a dry boxing prior to smoking.  My smoking time was close to two hours as I leisurely enjoyed it and at no point did it threaten to go out on its own.Value :  I picked these up as a 5 pack, which worked out to $3.96 a stick.  At under $5 this is an incredible value, with 20 count boxes available from $80-$100.

This cigar was a \u201cFox and the Hound\u201d which is, according to the Durango Pipe Tobacco Cigar website, \u201ca light bodied Virginia Cavendish, aged with vanilla beans to offer a creamy, lightly sweet taste and memorable pipe aroma.\u201d The website does not specify origin of tobacco or if other cigar sizes are available.  The site implies these are hand rolled with aged tobacco.  Opening the bag containing the cigars, I was accosted by the aroma of pipe tobacco, as if I had just opened a jar of pipe tobacco.Appearance :  Light Claro wrapper, with an appearance of a nice, traditional premium cigar wrapper.   However, the foot of the cigar has a bizarre appearance of light binder and very dark filler tobacco.  It is difficult to imagine this burning evenly.

A bit of coning due to the wetter filler tobacco, but much less than I expected.Flavor :  Pre-light draw was all pipe tobacco, which made me quite apprehensive.  The first puff was indeed overwhelming, but I grew accustom to the pipe tobacco flavor.  Strong vanilla flavor, though a bit like any vanilla-flavored cigar.  I cannot describe the flavors as I normally would in a review because the flavors are not traditional.  I am not a fan of flavored or infused cigars, but I do occasionally enjoy a pipe; however, this tobacco was just too bold to smoke with the delivery of a cigar.  People in the room with me (non-smokers) all raved about the aroma, just as they would if I had lit a pipe.  I\u2019m giving this a 3 of 5 because I think it would that is what the average pipe smoker might rate this.  Personally, I had to pitch the cigar before the halfway point because the flavors were way too much for me.Overall This is a pipe without the packing, tamping, lighting, and ritual.  For some, that ritual is the art of a pipe.  These cigars bypass the art and go straight to the smoke.  There is something to be said for a perfect \u201cpipe\u201d that requires no work.  Durango offers 10 different blends and I think you would have to try several to find what suits you most, just as you would in choosing pipe tobacco.   I must caution anyone who does not smoke a pipe that this Durango was closer in taste to a hookah than a traditional cigar.I ordered a five-pack of Durango\u2019s top four flavors based on the rave review of a friend.

She starts with the Gran Habano Cabinet Selection, an old release from the company.Created by the Rico family in Honduras, the Gran Habano Cabinet Selection Gran Consul is an impressive, meaty stick. The oily Corojo wrapper, the color of burnt sienna, is beautifully complimented by the dark red and silver band. The wrapper leaf is flecked with multiple small veins and a few minor imperfections but is overall very attractive. The length of this six-inch stick is firm and well rolled, finished in a gentle box-press. The cap is thick but messily mounted.The pre-light aroma is thick and earthy with gentle scents of oats, almonds, and hickory. The cold draw is woodsy but leaves a citrus tanginess on the tongue.Once lit, the initial few puffs are heavy with crushed black peppercorn and rich cedar. Midway into the first third the pepper mellows, and a nutty flavor develops on the back of the pallet while a citrus flavor lingers on the lips. The citrus flavor dissipates quickly and lets the toasty/nutty flavor take center stage.A meaty, full pallet flavor develops in the second third with underlying flavors of nutmeg, cocoa, and sweet spices. The flavor profile loses some depth towards the end of the second third which is dominated by a smoked hickory flavor.The final third starts out woodsy with a rich toasty tobacco base. The smoke soon picks up some light notes of black pepper and cedar. The cigar finishes with a surge of cocoa.The Gran Habano Cabinet Selection draws beautifully. Each pull produces huge plumes of thick, white smoke.  The burn is slow and cool, with a total smoking time of ninety-five minutes. The strong, compact ash is a beautiful snowy grey color with dark striations. The slow burn leaves a perfectly straight burn line. The ash grows to over an inch and a half before the first drop and maintains this pattern throughout. The ash drops a total of four times during the long, smooth smoke. The burn is cool enough for me to smoke the cigar down to the very nub.This was my first experience with the Gran Habano brand and I must admit that I was impressed.  The rich, complex smoke was the perfect addition to a lazy afternoon on the patio with a good book. I smoked four of these over the weekend and each time I discovered a hidden nuance in the flavor profile. I could smoke this cigar every day for a month and not get bored with it. It is listed as a full bodied stick but it wasn\u2019t the least bit overwhelming. It is certainly full flavored, but not overly powerful. The Gran Habano Cabinet Selection is delicious, pure and simple.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com.

This is a premium cigar and should be treated as such. Save this one for a good after dinner smoke with great friends. There are just too many great details about this cigar not to justify the price.Overall Rating :  What comes to mind most when going through the first two thirds of this cigar is Count Chocula cereal! The cereal notes backed with dark chocolate remind when I was a kid eating my morning dose of brown box sugary goodness. This is a very complex cigar with good power that is full bodied. Smoking this one slowly will reward the patient with an amalgamation of different flavors, because letting it burn hot will turn the chocolate/meaty notes severely bitter. All in all, if you can find them then these are definitely box worthy and should age very well.This post was written by Aaron.

This line was first introduced in 2007 and is named after the company's founder.  It is released in five vitolas in both Rosado and Oscuro: Robusto (5-1/2 x 52), Toro (6 x 60), Lonsdale, called the \"Lancero\" introduced in 2008 (7-1/2 x 40), Double Corona, called the \"Danno\" introduced in 2009 (7 x 56), and a Perfecto, called the \"Ruky\" also introduced in 2009 (5-5/8 x 52 figurado), costing around $8.00 each, give or take.  They are all hand-made in Esteli, Nicaragua under the supervision of Pepin Garcia.  Rene tells me the Rosados are mild to medium in body and the Oscuros are medium to full.  He hooked me up with a nice selection of each but for this review I smoked the Robusto and Perfecto - Rosado.The Rosado is made with Nicaraguan and Dominican tripa, a Nicaraguan capote, and a Nicaraguan capa which was silky with nice veins, no apparent flaws, and colorado rosado in color.  It had a very pleasant and mild tobacco pre-light aroma, seemed well packed, and squeezed well.  I made a straight cut on each and tested the pre-light draw which on the Robusto was very smooth and easy; on the Perfecto was a bit tighter.  This is not at all unusual considering that the Perfecto vitola starts from a small opening in the foot, widens suddenly, and then reduces again toward the head.They both lit very easily and almost right away the Perfecto's draw loosened up, certainly a result of skilled bunching.  They both started out with a nice, mild pepper / spice and the Perfecto seemed to have what was perhaps a mild coffee flavor as well.  In the first 1/3 the Robusto developed a mild tingle on the sides of the tongue and the Perfecto had a slight dryness on the tip.  They each produced plenty of light-grey smoke and a medium-grey ash which held on for over 2\".  Retro-exhalation was at first slightly hot but became smooth, easy, and pleasant after easing into it a time or two.  The Robusto had more pepper / spice than I was expecting which was consistent throughout, but never got too strong or overpowering at any time and held onto its medium body.  The Perfecto mellowed some after the initial pepper and presented what I thought were roasted coffee undertones and a dryness that followed each draw.  Shortly past the half-way point, a touch of spice re-emerged in the Perfecto which remained through to the end.  Again, the ash held on for over two inches on each and the burn was excellent all the way to the end.  I smoked them both to the nub and they never got tarry or bitter, even to the last puff.Overall I would have to emphasize the consistency of the Rosado throughout, and in my opinion they hold fast in the medium body realm.  They gave every indication of being a well made, high quality cigar both pre-light and while smoking.  The Nestor Miranda Collection - Special Selection Rosado is a very good cigar and I recommend you try it.  Its medium body and relatively mild strength makes it a good choice for early in the day or evenings and you don't need a full belly to enjoy it.

The family history has been featured in many write-ups and websites.  From their factories in Miami and Nicaragua, they have created great cigars such as the Signature 1932, the Serie 68, the Miami 9/11, and today\u2019s featured cigar the Padilla Cazadores.  This review will focus on the Cazadores Robusto.Appearance :  The Cazadores Robusto features an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper which looks like milk chocolate in color.  The cigar is very soft to the touch, and it has an oily feel to the touch.  No oily sheen is observed.  The wrapper had a fresh hay and sweet scent to it; the foot of the cigar had a noticeable fresh hay smell.The band was fairly ornate done using red, gold, and black colors; two seals featuring the \u201cP\u201d which is the trademark of the Padilla cigar were part of the band.  One of the Ps was larger than the other one.  One issue with the band was that the smaller seal was right on top of the seam of the band which made it difficult to remove without tearing the band.Construction :  Three large veins were observed running the length of the cigar.  Three soft spots were also noticed:  two towards the middle of the cigar and one right on top of the big \u201cP.\u201dOnce lighted up, the cigar had an uneven burn, and once the ash got to the second third of the cigar, a large hole was observed in the ash (see picture).  Either the cigar was rolled improperly, or not enough filler tobacco was used in the construction of the cigar.The dark-grey ash got to about an inch before it had to be tapped off.  The ash seemed fairly loose, and towards the last third of the cigar, it became fairly flaky.The draw was very easy; I think a bit too easy which may be the result of not enough filler tobacco.Flavor :  On pre-light, the cigar tasted spicy to the tongue, and it featured a fresh hay/barn taste on the draw.After lighting the cigar, the cigar had a woody and sweet notes on the retrohale which were very pleasant.  Towards the second third of the cigar, leathery notes were perceived.  The cigar also had a fairly long finish.The smoke was abundant, and it seemed to linger for a while.Unfortunately, towards the last third of the cigar, a hint of ammonia was detected.  The cigar was dry-purged to see if the ammonia taste could be removed, but it did not help.  The ammonia was not unbearable, but it was definitely a part of the flavor profile.Value :  For less than $5.00/cigar, this is not a bad purchase.  However, the cigar had some quality issues which diminished the value of the cigar.  In this price range, there are a significant number of cigars that would be a better value with less flaws.  Even with the flaws, this cigar is priced appropriately.Overall Rating :  From the flavor\u2019s point of view, the cigar had a very nice earthy and sweet flavor profile except towards the end where the ammonia was noticed.  From the construction\u2019s perspective, there was the issue with the soft spots and the hole towards the second third of the cigar.To me, this was not the best Padilla cigar that I have smoked.  Would I recommend it?  Yes, since this could be just one bad cigar out of the bunch.  Would I smoke it again?  Sure.  Just on the Padilla name alone, I know that the next Cazadores Robusto will be better than the one I just had - hopefully.This post was written by Ed.

Doc James Cigars.  With 2 locations in the county, their flagship in Shrub Oak and another in Mamaroneck, they are easy to get to and carry an incredibly wide line of sticks.  There are even a few rare gems in their vintage humidor that you will have a hard time finding anywhere else, if you are able to at all.Both locations have fantastic lounges that were designed to be both luxurious and fun.  They are very inviting and provide exceptionally well for the hundreds of members who enjoy all sorts of recreational activities there including darts, cards, watching sporting events and the many conversations centering on their love of cigars.  A feeling of camaraderie that we cigar smokers enjoy so much is always felt there, and Adam DeSiena, owner of the establishment is always there to enhance the experience in any way that he can.  Go visit them at Doc James Cigars & Golf, 952 East Main Street, Shrub Oak NY 10588.Now, on to the review\u2026For 20 years Adam DeSiena has been the owner and operator of Doc James Cigars in Westchester, NY, but along with this lucrative business venture he always wanted to delve into the manufacturing side of the cigar industry.  2011 got that ball rolling with a trip to Danli Honduras.  While touring the factories of the region, a stop at the Tobacos de Oriente cigar factory with the Alec Bradley Cigar Company proved to be a very interesting stop to say the least!Adam stumbled upon a batch of cigars labeled 312 that were being aged.  They were a work in progress, but Adam decided to sample the stick.  Something about the number 312 struck him, and with a few puffs and a little reflecting he realized the importance of the number.  3 for March (the third month in the year) and 12 for December (the twelfth month of the year) were the months his two children were born in.  Perhaps a sign from the cigar gods, and Adam knew that this was eventually going to be his new DeSiena blend.  With a little help from the cigar masters at Alec Bradley, and after several modifications, the new DeSiena 312 emerged ready for us to review\u2026The timing for this review is perfect being that we, The Tollaficionados not only can give you our opinions of the DeSiena 312, but also let you know that we are not alone in how we feel about the cigar.  A special event for the unveiling of this cigar took place on April 23rd at The Chophouse Grille in Mahopac, NY.  Over 70 cigar enthusiasts attended and the response was phenomenal.  Guests were given a steak dinner, all of the beer and/or wine that they could drink and two complimentary DeSiena 312\u2019s to puff on.   30 additional boxes were brought to the dinner and they all sold immediately.  Yes, the cigar is that good!This time around we have two reviewers.  Nick, Sr. taking the Robusto, and myself, Nick, Jr. handling the Toro.  Our fellow member of the Tollaficionado team, Neal phoned in his opinion of the Double Corona and I think it safe to say that the feeling and experiences that you read here from us two Nicks are echoed in Neal\u2019s experience.\u201cMy evaluation of DeSiena 4.5 inch Robusto\u2026My first impression was delight at the crispness of the packaging.  I recall thinking that this 4.5 inch Robusto had a clean and slightly oily wrapper.  I really was looking forward to my first draw so I torched this beauty and, to no surprise,  it did not disappoint!  Without any effort , it was lit and I was embarking on the first draw. There was absolutely no bite in the first and subsequent draws!  I love it when that happens!  Nothing bums me out worse than a stick that bites every single time!!  Through 25% of this gem, I experienced a smooth draw and an ever so slight Peppery taste.As a matter of fact, the Peppery taste lasted through almost the entire stick.  I was totally enamored by the smooth and easy draw for the better part of this experience.  The flavors kept on rolling well past the 75% \"marker\" \u2026 first Pepper, then a flavorful Oak taste, followed immediately by the usual great taste which a quality smoke imparts!  As you can well imagine, after that symphony of flavors\u2026 I will be \"coming back for more\".Doc James helped develop a great private label.  Thanks for the memories!!!\u201dAesthetically speaking, this review is starting out with flying colors!  And speaking of flying colors, the family crest on the band superimposed over the landscape of Siena, Italy made for a very impressive presentation.  It stands out beautifully against the dark and oily Nicaraguan Habano wrapper.Upon lighting this beauty, its aroma had immediate notes of espresso complimented by the flavors of light pepper and spice.  A subtle sweetness lingered on the lips and palette after each puff as well.  From here the flavor profile was a smooth and steady build.By the halfway point all was going particularly well with this cigar.  Perfect draw, no cracking and a complex medium/bold profile.  A stronger pepper presence was making itself known, and worked hand in hand with a touch of mocha and woody notes to give a fantastic taste sensation on the sides of the tongue.  The salt & pepper ash held firm as the cigar amped up on it way to its very long finish.In the home stretch I experienced something that I hadn\u2019t in a while.   Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I always want to make the most of the cigar smoking experience, savoring the moments and wanting them to go on and on.  The inevitable end of the smoke is always a satisfying yet sad experience when a really good cigar has been enjoyed.  Then there are times like these when you keep willingly burning your fingertips because you refuse to let the cigar end.  I kid you not, I enjoyed this cigar that much.An excellent cigar!  Do yourself a favor and pick some of these up.  You won\u2019t regret it!

Fortunately, I was able to get my hands on a couple shortly thereafter and chose it for this week\u2019s review.  Much like the visually unique barber pole style cigars many of us are familiar with, the Cabinetta Serie consists of a wrapper comprised of two leaf types.  The first five inches from foot to band sports a soft caramel colored Ecuadorian shade grown wrapper.  Roughly one inch of the head is overlaid by a significantly darker Nicaraguan Crillo wrapper.  While not as glaringly obvious as the barber poles, the differentiation between the two raises intrigue and demands a closer inspection.  The band helps to downplay the separate wrappers by encircling the barrel where the two colors join.  The burnt sienna and soft gold hues do wonders to tie in the colors of the cigar.  I would have liked to see the cream border removed, however, to allow the band to blend into the cigar, thereby enhancing its already earthy appearance.Due to the pale tone of the Ecuadorian wrapper veins are more visible but the cigar is smooth to the touch and none of them are prominent.  Giving the cigar a few gentle pinches reveals a firm base, which gives slightly but bounces back into place.  There are no soft spots and an inspection of the head reveals a well positioned and secure double cap.  Lining up my guillotine cutter, I make a quick firm motion.  Inspection of the cut reveals that it was not as clean as I I would have liked towards the center.  Testing the draw though, assuages any fears I may have had because it is perfect.  The flavor is very natural with a nutty hay flavor.  A trace of sweetness lingers on the lips afterwards.Torching the foot, the Cabinetta Serie takes to the flame quite well and is shortly burning.  First notes reveal a mild flavor that is quite sweet.  A tingling sensation imparts itself on the lips and tongue.  That sweet flavor found at the beginning abruptly stops and reveals a sole flavor of tobacco, which is a good thing with such a mild smoke.  Inspection of the burn is very contrary to the construction experience prelight.  Flakey, dark grey ash is revealed and accompanied by quite an irregular burn.  When attempting to rotate the cigar to touch up a runaway spot another inevitably takes its place.  Looking at the foot also reveals an interesting phenomenon.  The wrapper is so thin that it burns faster than the binder and filler.  The binder is also quite thick and burning somewhat slower than the filler to create a bit of a tunnel effect.  Attempting to fix this naturally for about the first inch without much progress, I decide to take more extreme measures.  Tapping off the rather loose ash I perform a complete relight in an attempt to even out the burn and heat the binder even more to get it going.After a few outward puffs to purge the smoke, soft sweet notes come back again and coupled with the hay remind me of clover.  The light tones of grass, hay and sweetness  produces a very balanced and satisfying flavor profile.  Large volumes of thick white smoke linger, even outdoors.  Thanks to the touch up, the burn has become much more manageable.  While the line is still wavy and ash flakey, there are no more runaways and the ash holds on for a couple of inches thus bringing bringing this smoke to about the halfway point.It is at this mark that the grass gives way to a more emboldened wood flavor.  This continues until 1/3 of the stick is left; about an inch away from the Nicaraguan portion of the wrapper.  Here, two things occur.  First, the binder actually appears to expand and bulge thereby breaking through the thin Ecuadorian wrapper.  Second, the flavor turns quite harsh, likely from the exposing of the cigar\u2019s innards to the outside air.  Despite this I push through, touching up as I go, mostly for want of  getting to the darker wrapper at the head to determine if the flavor profile changes significantly.  Reaching this point, I am disappointed to find that the profile remains harsh, probably from the tainted flavors earlier, so I let this one finish on its own in the ashtray while I collecting my thoughts.Overall, the initial appearance of this cigar is quite becoming.  The contrast of the two smooth wrappers compliments each other very well and Drew Estates\u2019 choice in band is almost perfect.  This cigar is surely in the mild to medium range of the spectrum and although I often choose a medium to full bodied cigar, I am delighted by the smooth, consistent taste this one exhibits.  The only shortcoming of this particular cigar is in its construction.  The poor burn, flakey ash, and rice paper thin wrapper detracted from the easy smoking experience we strive for and likely accounted for the harsh flavor towards the end.  Despite these problems the cigar was quite enjoyable.  The flavor was so balanced and true that this one will find itself in my hand again.  More encouraging is that afterwards I read through several other reviews to see if the construction problems are commonplace and the answer appears to be resoundingly, no.  So if my experience is out of the norm, which it certainly appears to be, I would actually recommend picking up one or more of these to try especially at a MSRP of ~$6.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

There have been lots of mixed reviews on this cigar, which personally I think is a good thing.  We must remember that the art of cigar smoking is just that\u2026 an art.  Some people\u2019s trash is another\u2019s treasure, and that is the beauty of this leisure.  Since there has been so much rave about this cigar I decided to go ahead and voice my thoughts about the Tatuaje 7th Capa Especial.Before we begin I want to make note that this cigar is actually rolled at the My Father cigar factory in Esteli, Nicaragua just like the rest of the Reserva brown label line (instead of in Miami), and the Capa Especial is carrying a Sumatra wrapper instead of Connecticut Broadleaf.The Tatuaje 7th Capa Especial bore a rough looking, veiny, brown wrapper with a somewhat reddish hue.  The bands accented the cigar nicely without taking over all the attention.  Pre-light smell was a succulent sweet tobacco.  A lumpy triple seam cap topped the cigar and after being cut the cold draw showed perfect resistance.  Spice and vanilla were the primary findings on the cold draw.Bam!  Right out of the gate the Tatuaje 7th Capa Especial was a full-bodied monster with tons of spicy, peppery, thick white smoke.  The aroma was sweetly pleasing and the draw perfect.  After just a few minutes of smoking the cigar backed down in the pepper department but still remained full-bodied.  Notes of a light breadiness were found in the first third but not very focused as the pepper took control.Heading into the second third the bread/dough taste turned into a pronounced nuttiness, almost like a thick peanut butter note.  The smoke volume was still thick and spice remained hidden on the back of the palate.  The burn on the cigar, for the most part, remained even and never caused an issue.The final third of my Tatuaje 7th Capa Especial did not disappoint.  The flavors picked up intensity with the pepper making a re-appearance (similar to the start), but not nearly as heavy.  The finish even though spicy and full-bodied was not harsh, as you would expect from a young cigar.  Instead the ending showed notes of a creamy, leathery sweetness\u2026 most pleasing!Overall I\u2019ve smoked four of these cigars and the tasting profile and performance from stick to stick has been very consistent.  Typically I associate that type of consistency with the Padron brand but the Tatuaje 7th Capa Especial has been very consistent.  So, other bloggers' opinions aside, whatever they may be, I thoroughly enjoyed this cigar and recommend it for those smokers looking for a spicy full-bodied experience.Pre-Light: 8 pts.

This is a good looking torpedo with a creamy, light brown Ecuadorian grown Connecticut wrapper. It is fairly smooth and silky looking with only a few small veins. It is well filled and has a pleasant tobacco aroma. This is a handsome looking cigar.The Edge Lite starts off very smooth and remains smooth all the way to the nub.  The initial flavors were creamy and woody with no spice at all.  It was mild and pleasant, but not at all bland.  The flavors are light and crisp, and they remain pretty consistent throughout the smoke, nicely complimented by notes of toasted nuts and hints of leather at different points in the smoke.  It has a slightly sweet finish that doesn\u2019t linger for too long.  The burn was perfect from start to finish.  It produced a ton of thick creamy smoke and had a firm white ash.  The construction on this cigar was superb.On his website Rocky boasts that The Edge Lite is the perfect Golf Course cigar.  He says you can sit this cigar down for 10 to 15 minutes and when you pick it back up it will still be lit and ready to smoke. I was skeptical so I put it to the test and put the cigar down for a little more than 10 minutes.  I picked it up and took a puff\u2026  I\u2019m impressed.  It had stayed lit and the burn remained straight.  I have never had a cigar that could go a whole 10 minutes without a draw and still stay lit.  I am a little curious how Rocky has accomplished this, but he tells the truth.  This cigar will stay lit, even without you drawing on it for more than 10 minutes.The Edge Lite has turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It is smooth, consistent and flavorful.  I think it is an excellent example of a mild cigar that actually has flavor.  At less than $6 a stick, I think this could be a nice cheaper alternative to a Cabaiguan.  I am not saying it is a replacement for them, just a cheaper \u201calternative\u201d.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Not only was the company able to recover the distribution rights for their brands but they also founded the Tora\u00f1o Family Cigar Company.  The first thing the Tora\u00f1o Family Cigar Company did was release three new blends: Single Region Jalapa Series, Brigade, and Master by Carlos Tora\u00f1o.Master by Carlos Tora\u00f1o was created by master roller, Felipe Sosa.  This blend is rolled in a small factory in Esteli Nicaragua with intent to be a small production cigar.  The Master is available in three different sizes and each retails for under $6.00 USD:  Robusto 5 x 50; Churchill 7 x 50; Torpedo 6 \u00bc  x 52.The pre-light smell for the Master gave way to hints of wet tobacco and honey.  The well-constructed cap was the beginning to the smooth oily wrapper.  There were no soft spots detected however the foot of the cigar was cut a little uneven.  The loose pre-light draw only confirmed the wet tobacco and honey scents.The opening on the Master had a very fresh tobacco taste and tons of white smoke.  This mild to medium bodied cigar had a lopsided burn that supported a very brittle, powdery, white ash.  I had somewhat of a difficult time pinpointing tasting notes in the first third but thought I detected some woodsy, floral notes on the palate.The second third of my Master by Carlos Tora\u00f1o certainly picked up, putting the cigar into the medium bodied range.  I had no trouble picking up the leather and spice present in this third.  The burn remained wavy and the smoke thick and white.When moving into the final third the burn finally evened itself out.  Again, I had trouble pinpointing the tasting notes but every now and then I was able to get small bursts of vanilla (not enough vanilla to fully classify it). The Master did end with a tiny hint of fruit on the palate but it wasn\u2019t impressive notes.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/101_1748-450x3371.jpg?iv=16"}, "tatuaje the frank": {"origin": "Origin : USA Format : Double Corona Size : 7 5/8\u2033 x 49 Wrapper : Sun-Grown Broadleaf Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $13 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "tatuaje", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["I just came back from a trip to South Korea about 2 weeks ago.

OK, the truth is I couldn\u2019t bring myself to break into the coffin yet so this one is an extra single I picked up but it came from a coffin too, just not mine.  The Frank is a special ultra-limited release from Pete Johnson and his Tatuaje brand.  Using the blend for the Tatuaje Taino, the corojo wrapper is replaced with a sun-grown broadfleaf wrapper and in place of the brown band is a ghoulish green band adorned with the Tatuaje name and trademark flor de lys.  They were released as a first in a series of 13 special Halloween cigars from Tatuaje.  Only 666 boxes were made and they were released to just 13 retailers selected by lottery throughout the States.  In the coffin shaped box are 13 monstrous cigars.  I was lucky enough to have my local cigar shop, Empire Cigars, selected as one of the 13 retailers to get The Frank.  What makes me even luckier is that I was able to get myself a box of these rare and special treats.Since Empire was one of the 13 to get The Frank, they will not be eligible for next year's release which will be \u201cThe Drac\u201d.  The Drac is reported to be a torpedo that is banded at the foot and placed into their coffins upside down just like the way Dracula was reported to like sleeping in his coffin.  We\u2019ll have to wait and see how lucky I am next year at trying to get my hands of a box of those.  For now, it is time to get back to The Frank\u2026The Frank is a box pressed double corona, but it is only a slight box press and rather irregular at that.  Some of the sticks don\u2019t even look like they are box pressed at all.  I am guessing the point of the box press was to square off the look of the cigar to match the squared off look of Frankenstein\u2019s Monster\u2019s head.  They kind of missed on the execution though.  The coffin is really just a uniquely shaped slide-top cabinet.  Box pressed cigars are usually in a dress box which is where they typically get their pressed shape from.  The Frank is packaged loosely in a bundle secured with a ribbon and then wrapped in paper.  I don\u2019t know how the cigars were pressed, but the way they are packaged for sale would account for why the press looks so irregular and why some of the sticks in my box look to have lost their box press shape altogether.The wrapper is a dark beauty.  It is oily and toothy, capped in the Cuban style like all Tatuajes. The cigar smells of cedar no doubt due to the cedar coffin it sleeps in.  I used the \u201cthree match\u201d technique to slowly light the foot to be sure to take my time and enjoy the experience of this rare smoke from start to finish.The Frank starts off like just about any other Tatuaje, delivering a blast of black pepper that dominated for the first inch or so.  Once the pepper started to mellow the effect of the wrapper on the Taino blend becomes very apparent.  Along with the black pepper there is what I like to refer to as \u201csun-grown twang\u201d.  It is a slightly sweet flavor with a kick of spice to it and it is a major reason why I love cigars with sun-grown broadleaf wrappers.  This wrapper completely changes the flavor profile of the blend compared to when it is wrapped in a corojo leaf for the Brown Label Taino.  The black pepper combined with the sun-grown twang remains the core of the cigar intermingled with notes of coffee and earth as I approached the halfway mark.  This is a monster of a cigar not just in its imposing size, but also because of its full body and stout strength.  Not quite as powerful as its corojo wrapped brother, it is still a fairly strong cigar.  Just past the halfway mark I started to pick up some cocoa along with flashes of coffee.  The pepper is always present but the \u201ctwang\u201d subsided a bit.  It also got very creamy with a nutty flavor on the finish.  Unfortunately this was short lived.  Inside the last third it begins to pick up again.  Lots of black pepper and the sun-grown twang is back as well until you get into the nub territory and then it\u2019s all black pepper all the time for that last couple inches. It was in the last couple inches where I found the only negative thing I have to say about the cigar.  At the end, it really began to show its youth as I caught a few strong blasts of ammonia.  Thinking back on the rest of the smoke I think I may have been catching subtle hints of this once and a while as I thought I detected something \u201cfunny\u201d.  It was so subtle though that I dismissed it.  I think it may have been little hits of ammonia.  The good thing is youth is a fixable problem.  I\u2019ll give them plenty of rest and give that ammonia some time to work itself outta there.I have to say I was pretty impressed with The Frank.  It is an excellent, complex smoke and I am amazed by the effect the sun-grown broadleaf wrapper had on this blend.  It is a completely different monster than the Taino even though it utilizes the same blend for the filler.  I look forward to slowly enjoying these over the next several years.Update: I revisited this cigar in April 2011.

The wrapper continued to crack on occasion during smoking.Thankfully, the burn was for the most part even.  The draw was good and only one minor touch up was needed past the halfway mark.  The ash remained firm and was never an issue.Flavor :  (3.75) Pre-light, the cigar had a sweet, pleasant and almost floral aroma. Hints of sweet wood, tea and natural tobacco.  The pre-light draw revealed interesting notes of dried figs/dates, tea, sweet cedar and a touch of spice.The first third of the Legacy offered up a lot of smoke that can best be described as silky, creamy and sweet.  Flavors were mainly sweet wood with dried fruit and occasional hints of caramel.  Black pepper was noticeable but not overwhelming.  There were hints of tea and sweet earthy notes with the smoke itself having a creamy texture to it.  The finish was medium to long with an almost cinnamon-like heat lingering at the end.The second third offered up more of the same but with a little less spice and a little less dried fruit, instead, there was an increase in the grassy notes of the cigar with some mustiness noticeable on occasion. Overall it remained sweet and consistent with the first third. There were occasional hints of bitterness but never too extreme as to detract from the experience.As I passed the halfway mark the cigar continued to give off pleasant sweet notes of dried fruit, sweet cedar, earth, hints of tea and some caramel like aftertaste.  At this point there was no spice at all detectable in the finish. The smoke continued to have a silky sweet texture to it. There were some increased woodsy and grassy notes on the finish.The final third offered more of the same.  I continued to get thick clouds of smoke with hints of dried fruit, figs and some grassy notes on my palate. A little spice returned to the back of the palate and the finish remained medium to long and mainly sweet with a little creamier texture to the smoke. There was the occasional bitter note but perhaps this was somewhat exaggerated by the fact that the cigar is quite sweet so any semi-sweet areas can trick your palate into thinking that the cigar was bitter.From the band onwards there was a noticeable decline in sweetness and much of the dried fruit and velvety creaminess was gone.  The cigar was at this point mainly grassy and earthy with hints of bitter tea and leather.  Sensing warmer smoke and declining flavors I laid it to rest.Value :  It\u2019s hard to argue with a cigar that gave me an hour and a half of a mainly enjoyable experience for less than $7.00.

Then, a year later, they are still readily available, everywhere. But in the case of the new CAO Amazon Basin, its rarity is only part of the intrigue. It\u2019s truly a cigar with a story to tell. I was lucky enough to get one of the last available boxes, and now, four cigars in, consider myself lucky indeed.According to the official CAO statement, the Amazon Basin cigar \u201cutilizes rare organic tobacco cultivated at small farms in remote regions of the Amazonian Rainforest. The tobacco called \u2018Braganca\u2019 is grown in virgin lands and is harvested just once every three years\u2026the leaves are rolled by hand into tubes called \u2018carottes\u2019, and left to rest under high pressure. After six months of natural fermentation inside the carrotes, they are transported by canoe from the rainforest and delivered to our factory.\u201d Wow, that\u2019s quite a story! One interesting aspect of cigar smoking is how we experience exotic locales through the tobaccos we smoke. And the Amazonian Rainforest is about as exotic as it gets. If nothing else, smoking an Amazon Basin cigar is a curiosity. But what I\u2019ve discovered is a cigar so unique; it actually lives up to the hype.One look at this cigar and you know it\u2019s different. Instead of a paper band, the cigar is fashioned with a rope ring, neatly coiled around its Colorado Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper. This gives the cigar an artisan look, and lets the smoker know he/she is entering unexplored territory. The CAO Amazon Basin boasts a five nation blend, and examining the foot, we see myriad tobaccos ranging from black to light brown. Judging from its intense, un-lit aroma, one could anticipate a rich smoking experience. The smell of licorice sweetness prevails, and the pre-lit draw foreshadows an earthy spice. To the touch, the wrapper is rough and thick, adding to the Amazon\u2019s primitive presentation. CAO also maximizes the cigar\u2019s primal aura with a box that looks like it came from a turn of the century Amazonian expedition.Upon lighting you immediately taste a flavor profile like no other. With intense fruit and molasses, the CAO Amazon Basin delivers tremendous flavor and complexity. I\u2019m not usually a fan of Brazilian tobacco, and earthy cigars can sometimes leave the taste of dirt in my mouth. But these cigars are well balanced, with just the right amount of earthiness. It\u2019s got a raisin-like sweetness that compliments a rich tobacco flavor. Smoking further, the flavors meld, and become smooth and creamy. Midway to the nub, the Amazon gets smoother still, never developing that tar-like finish sometimes associated with cigars of intense earthiness. It appears that Rick Rodriguez, a Master Blender at General Cigars, was careful not to overload this blend with too much of what makes it unique.Amazingly, the Amazon Basin is a fairly mild cigar. To get this much flavor from a stick usually requires lots of high priming, ligero tobacco. This can often mean cigars that knock you for a loop. But one can smoke this cigar in the morning, with no ill effects.Much like a trip down the Amazon, this cigar offers wonders, but also danger. Every cigar I smoked had burn issues. All required multiple touchups, an annoyance that compromised my enjoyment of these otherwise wonderful cigars. I also discovered that, like the jungle itself, the Amazon Basin gets hot. I had to be careful to hold the sticks with the lit end pointing skyward. This allowed the cigar to burn cooler.A cigar smoker is a vicarious traveler. We experience remote cultures with each cigar we smoke. In the CAO Amazon Basin, we travel into the deepest rainforest, and get a sense of having truly visited a different world. It\u2019s a shame these cigars are so rare, but I guess that\u2019s part of their allure. I\u2019ll be sure to save one for the soon-to-be-announced Great Robustojoe Cigar Giveaway IV.

Pete Johnson\u2019s seemingly ever broadening use of the sun grown broadleaf wrapper found its way onto two new Tatuaje Reserva cigars.  The Reserva Regios and the Reserva Noellas.  The new Reserva Noellas are particularly intriguing to me because this is not the first time there has been a Reserva Noella.Back in 2006 Tatuaje offered to a number of its best accounts boxes of  Noellas cigars with a Reserva label on the box.  This label was applied just as it has always been on the boxes other Reserva cigars like the J21 and SW.  There were only about 200 boxes made.  The cigar is the same size as the standard Noellas but it has a different wrapper.  Instead of the standard Corojo wrapper that is used on the regular Noellas, these cigars are wrapped in an aged oscuro ligero wrapper just like what is used on the Cojonu line of Tatuajes and the Reserva J21.  Unlike other Reserva cigars this incarnation of the Reserva Noellas did not sport the second black and gold Reserva band.  They only had the normal brown Tatuaje band on them.  The only way to know it was a Reserva is to have seen the box it came from, or if you put it side by side with one of the regular Noellas you would see that the wrapper is much darker in color (note: I have found this to be truer of older Noellas which seem to have gotten darker in more recent vintages).  The 2006 Reserva Noella was tagged with a nick name, often referred to as a Noella Oscuro in online forums and websites.  After that initial run in 2006, Tatuaje never made this cigar again.  That is still true today even though we once again have a cigar bearing the Reserva Noellas name\u2026Here we are in 2009 and we once again have the Reserva Noellas available at many Tatuaje retailers.  But this 2009 edition is not the same cigar that was made back in 2006.  It is still the same size and same blend, but the wrapper has changed again.  The 2009 edition sports a sun grown broadleaf wrapper just like the Tatuaje Monster Series released last October.  It also wears the black and gold Reserva band unlike its predecessor and this one, while somewhat limited, is not restricted to just a one time run of 200 boxes.    I believe that this cigar is meant to be a mainstay in the Reserva line.  It along with its cousin the Reserva Regios have been nick named by some as \u201clittle monsters\u201d because they share a very similar makeup to \u201cThe Frank\u201d with their broadleaf wrappers around the original blends for those vitolas.I thought it would be fun, since I happen to have a few of those old Reserva Noellas from 2006 in my humidor, to go ahead and do a side by side comparison of the two different cigars which bear this name.  I started with the 2006 edition\u2026The 2006 Reserva Noellas have a very dark brown, leathery looking wrapper.  My specimens all have a puckered vein running down their sides just like I have seen on a many of the Cuban cigars I have sampled.  The triple cap is flawless, applied by a master of their craft.  A quick snip with my Palio and my first test draw reveals perfection.  The draw is spot on with just the right amount of resistance.  This cigar is nearing its third birthday and it shows its age.  Right from the start the flavors are smooth yet robust.  Amazingly rich flavors of toasted tobacco complemented by cocoa and spice rest heavy on the palate.  The finish is full and meaty, and though it lingers I find I wish it would hang around even longer.  Smoking this cigar was like sitting down to a three course dinner of steak and potatoes.  The flavors were so rich and so big it seemed almost impossible that they were coming from a cigar of such diminutive size.  The aroma produced by the cigar was decadent and could be described as rich and full on its own.  The cigar was dynamic and it was hard to keep track of all the different flavors I was experiencing.  It never really settled into any one thing for long as the tobacco, cocoa, coffee, cedar, and a myriad of spices kept swirling in only to fade out and come back again later.  This was the best Tatuaje I have ever smoked.  I have smoked a couple before and remember them to be amazing cigars, but this cigar on this day was just spectacular.  It was so smooth, so rich, and very heady.  I was in bliss the whole time I was smoking it. I only have a couple left in my humidor.  I hope they can at least come close to living up to this.I waited a bit before smoking the new 2009 edition of the Reserva Noellas.  I did not want to have its experience influenced by being too close to the amazing event that was the Noellas Oscuro.  I waited until the memory of that smoke wasn\u2019t so fresh in my mind, and then I fired up the new sun grown edition\u2026The sun grown wrapper is veiny, dark, oily, and toothy giving the cigar a very rustic look.  It too is crowned by an expertly applied triple cap and dual bands collar the neck of this corona.  Construction is predictably superb and the draw is almost perfect.  After a short peppery blast, the wrapper exhibits its influence over this smaller ring size.  The 2009 version of the Reserva Noellas is very much like the Reserva Regios.  Only the slightly sweet, sun-grown \u201ctwang\u201d is much more prevalent here pushing the other flavors of cedar, earth, and spices further into the background.  It is a complex smoke with a nice little punch, but lacks some of the depth of flavor that the Reserva Regio had.  I know this is supposed to be a comparison to the other Noella, but this cigar is so very much like it\u2019s bigger brother that I have to keep coming back to that.  I talked about how the Reserva Regio seemed to escalate as you smoked it in my review of that cigar. The Noellas didn\u2019t do the same.  For that reason, I would rank the Reserva Regio ahead of this Noella.  As for how it compares to the original 2006 Reserva Noellas.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but it simply doesn\u2019t.Both versions of the Reserva Noellas are excellent cigars.  It may not sound like it here, but I really do like the 2009 edition very much, it just happens that it doesn\u2019t stand up well to its name sake or its bigger brother the Reserva Regios.  That said, it is still an excellent smoke that would, in my opinion, stand up easily to most any other smoke you\u2019d like to compare it to.  However, the final verdict of this showdown is that the 2006 edition of the Reserva Noellas is probably the best Tatuaje I have ever smoked and the 2009 version ranks among the top 6 or 7 Tatuajes.  I will say to be fair, that the 2006 Noella does have a considerable advantage in the age department being 3 years old, but I think the difference the wrapper makes on this size and blend would make the Oscuro version the winner even if they were closer in age.  I wish that when Pete brought back the Reserva Noellas he did so with that Oscuro wrapper.  Alas he did not, but what he did bring us is quite good in its own right.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It is also one of the very few vitolas that does not sport a box press.  It uses the same dark and leathery Ecuadorian Sun Grown wrapper as the rest of the line.  Long time readers of my blog already know that I am not a fan of this large of a ring gauge on a cigar.  I feel that the Wizard is a prime example of why that is.  All the wonderful flavors that you\u2019d expect from a VSG are muted and muddled in this format.  There are still notes of earth and leather and sweet spice but they are not as sharp or intense.  The cigar overall is milder and weaker than the other vitolas in the line.  It is a good cigar in a line of great cigars which makes it a bit of a disappointment for me.

After many years of success Avo Uvezian began releasing limited edition cigars to mark and celebrate his own birthday.  Today I will be reviewing the AVO 80th Anniversary which was released in 2006 (7+ years of age on it). The release is only available in one size (Belicoso), just as with all the limited editions, so without further ado...The first thing I noticed about my AVO 80th was the chocolate oily sheen the wrapper of the cigar bore.  Foot of the cigar was jammed packed full of tobacco with the cap a nicely finished point.  The cream colored double bands looked nice against the dark wrapper of the cigar and the pre-light smell was sweet with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg.  The cold draw revealed signs of cherry and fruits with ease.The first third of the cigar started slowly as I had trouble getting the cigar to stay lit.  Once we finally got going the cigar immediately opened up full-bodied with huge volumes of white smoke.  The draw was absolutely effortless and the burn wavy with a gray powdery ash.  Beginning tastes of my AVO 80th were somewhat empty however I did note nuts and pepper with an odd spice during the first third.Into the second third of my AVO 80th the cigar backed down into the medium bodied category.  Once again the cigar had construction issues, as it did not want to stay lit.  The burn, when lit, remained wavy with nuts and spice continuing to be the primary tasting components.During the final third the cigar continued to have burn problems.  The taste turned somewhat meaty but again the nuts and spice were still present.  Also, there was so much glue holding the band on I was not able to properly remove it without cracking the wrapper. This forced me to stop smoking early, which may have not been a bad thing.My final impression of the AVO 80th Anniversary is bland.  The burn inconsistency really hurt this cigar.  After all if the cigar won\u2019t burn or draw then it isn\u2019t going to get you very far.  The flavors weren\u2019t fantastic and the cigar never really went anywhere for me.  For the price tag on these the experience was not worth it\u2026 I\u2019d say pass.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 6 pts. Overall Experience: 5 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

While raking and trimming I decided to find a smoke that would be quick and wouldn\u2019t require too much attention. The Illusione 68 fit the bill. Here\u2019s my take\u2026Prelight: A sweet tobacco smell that is reminiscent of Illusione, prelight draw was great with that same sweet tobacco flavor. Construction appeared good for a vitola of this stature, with no visible imperfections and a beautiful Cafe Colorado wrapper. Let us torch it!1/3: Initially this little puppy packed a punch, with handfuls of spice coupled with a slight sweetness. I equate it to getting smacked around a bit, but not too hard\u2026tough love. The full bodied flavor sticks out right away, but the smoke is smooth and plentiful. The burn is razor sharp, and draw is perfect. The olfactory sweetness that is Illusione is very predominate in this stick\u2026a distinct floral sweetness.2/3: Ash is holding on about 1/2\u2033\u2026 the burn and draw is still perfect! So far this seems like a very well constructed cigar. The sweet flavors have come on top of the spiciness now, with smooth smoke and full body. I love the sweet smell of the smoke, and it\u2019s changed a bit to a caramel sweetness.3/3: The spice came back in full force, and the sweetness took a back seat. The smoke was a little bitter, but that didn\u2019t last too long. Burn is great and the draw is still perfect. In the final minutes of this cigar the sweetness came back a bit, the spice subsided, the flavor has turn to hints of leather, and the bitterness disappeared. Aroma is still playing the right tunes with my nose.Appearance :  The Bombone has that distinct Illusione look, with a beautiful Colorado wrapper and simple trademark band.

The Four Kicks brand by Crowned Heads is produced by Ernesto Perez Carillo in the Dominican Republic for owner Jon Huber and Mike Conder.  Being relatively new to the cigar world the brand has received very high accolades already, so let's see how the Four Kicks fairs.Available in 24 count boxes the Four Kicks consist of the following vitolas :On to the review\u2026The Four Kicks Corona Gorda had a nice sandy brown wrapper with lots of rough veins.  The cap was a beautifully constructed triple seam and a radiant sweet, floral smell was easily detected from this stick.  Cold draw was tight with hints of sweet fruit and barnyard.  The band on the cigar was quite simple however accented the cigar very nicely.The opening on the Four Kicks showed a spicy full-bodied pepper taste profile.  A little further into the first third the cigar developed a nice leathery, woody taste.  The pepper notes did remain however more on the finish of the palate.Aroma was similar to a roasting wood stove and the burn wavy.  The cigar was producing a lot of dense white smoke and is easily in the full body category.  The transition into the second third had a nice soft creaminess that I thoroughly enjoyed.The second third of my Four Kicks still showed a wavy inconsistent burn.  Cigar did move back in body however was still medium/full bodied.  Tastes in the second third were not as elaborate as the first with a consistent sweet and salty earthiness accompanied by a rustic aroma.Into the final third the cigar decided to split.  Do know this only happened on one of the three samples I smoked however all of them had an extremely tight draw on the final third and almost seemed plugged in some cases\u2026The finish on the Four Kicks varied however I tended to get notes of woody pepper and a odd wet cardboard tastes.  I was honestly disappointed as the cigar started so well.After all the hype I\u2019ve read on this cigar I certainly do not agree with a lot of the other online cigar enthusiasts.  Not that they\u2019re right and I\u2019m wrong or visa versa.  At the end of the day it comes down to preference and for me this cigar is not a complete winner in my book.  Don\u2019t let me confuse you, as the cigar is of decent quality with an outstanding opening however the consistency I received in the finish from my three samples was not what quality should be.  I think I will however look to get some of the other sizes available.  Maybe the corona gorda was just a strike out in this blend???Pre-Light: 9 pts. Smoking: 6 pts.

The bands provided only 2 clues, 1 that these are handmade and 2, they were produced in Esteli, Nicaragua. Based on those findings my curiosity was definitely piqued. Closer examination of the box stamp revealed these were manufactured by Tabacalera Tropical. My muse was found!  Being a huge fan of their JFR (Just For Retailers) blend I was excited to expand my experience with this band.Formerly known as ANGANORSA of Esteli, Nicaragua, possessing some of the largest and most productive holdings in Nicaragua in terms of agricultural and manufacturing, its 10,000 bale per annum production was supervised by its President and owner, former New York City financier, Eduardo Fernandez. Its substantial agricultural holdings are in the critically acclaimed regions of Esteli, Ocotal, and Jalapa Valley. The Jalapa region is blessed with a micro-climate that has been likened to that of the renowned Vuelta Abajo region of Cuba, where all types of leaf are effectively grown, but only the finest of leaves are selected for Habanos S.A. production.2001 saw the addition of Don \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia as Master Blender.  For those who may not know \u201cPepin\u201d is a renowned blender and master roller from Havana, his influence being seemingly everywhere in the cigar business over the last 8 years. His prolific blends have received the highest of accolades. This step, no doubt, afforded them the opportunity to begin to effectively capitalize on the exceptional tobaccos they continue to grow.In 2002 Eduardo Fernandez acquired Tropical Tobacco of Tampa, Florida, thus creating Tabacalera Tropical, and with that acquisition the additional blending and cigar business expertise of Pedro Martin. This step created the cornerstone of their Vertical Integration process, what they refer to as \u201cFrom Seed to Ash\u201d. This concept provides Tabacalera Tropical with unprecedented control throughout the production, manufacture and distribution of their products, thus securing a consistent and high quality experience for the enthusiast.Appearance :  Upon first introductions this cigar has a very Cuban appearance.

Ash is a dark gray and holds strong to the body, remaining intact for over 2\u201d.Flavor :  The flavor profile of this cigar, while not being very complex, and offering  little evolution, does receive high marks for its versatility. It is balanced, full flavored and medium to medium full bodied. Interestingly it does not offer a typical Maduro flavor profile, as this experience had no flavors, aromas, or notes of sweetness, however; it does present a wonderful Serrano chili pepper spiciness on the first palette, providing a savory roasted Ancho chili and Mesquite briquette flavor on the second palette. A wonderful thing as this profile affords many exciting and festive pairing opportunities! It represents a welcomed addition to the complete food, drink and smoke experience. A few pairings where this cigar would perform exceptionally well would be with Cuban cuisine, or Caribbean Jerked meats with Mojitos. I feel that a dark beer, i.e. Negro Modella, would be a counterproductive selection, as it would put its flavor profile in conflict.Value :  At roughly 6USD retail, and having stellar distribution, it provides a quality experience that is accessible to most enthusiasts.Overall Rating :  This cigar is unmistakably and eerily Cuban in its character.

In my review of the Signature I mentioned that Heberto Padilla was a Cuban poet and linked to a profile of him that was written by Cigarfan at The Keepers of the Flame.  Where the Signature 1932 celebrated Ernesto\u2019s father\u2019s birthday, the Series \u201968 commemorates the year his father was placed under house arrest for his series of poetry that was very critical of the Castro regime in Cuba. It is a limited edition cigar with only 100,000 cigars produced.  The Series \u201968 has another unique attribute.  It is made in Honduras.  As far as I know all the other Padilla cigars are made in Nicaragua and Miami.  The Series \u201968 is made for Padilla by Flores Tobacco in Honduras.  Made mostly of Nicaraguan tobacco, it does contain some Honduran tobacco in the filler.The Series \u201968 is an handsome looking cigar with a smooth, dark brown wrapper that has a dry appearance to it.  It has a Padron Anniversary like look to it enhanced by the dual bands.  Under the standard cigar band is a second band containing a serial number very much like the send serialized band found on the Padron 1964 Anniversary cigars.  You can see the second band sticking out below the top band in the picture above.  Just click the picture to get an enlarged view.I really enjoyed how this cigar starts off.  Slightly sweet with some spice that I would describe as clove, it is very smooth right from the beginning.  It didn\u2019t take long for the clove flavors to fade though.  About an inch and a half in it mellows out a lot and has a somewhat nondescript creaminess with a nutty undertone, but in truth it\u2019s muddled and kind of bland. It remained pretty consistent the rest of the way, never changing except that it started to develop a slightly bitter finish.  It picked up a little towards the end getting a little spicy but it just never did anything to hold my attention.  The construction was very good though.  The burn was even, the ash well formed but required tapping every inch or so.  It is a pleasant enough smoke that shows some promise at the start but it just never lives up to it.  A bit too mild and one dimensional for my tastes.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Here is a short intro that he wrote:Joe K calls the upper Midwest home, currently residing in Wisconsin with his wife.  Although he smoked cigars on and off throughout the past 8 years or so, it was not until this past year that he grew a certain affinity for them.  While traveling, he mentioned to a business associate that he was looking for some cigars for his mates in light of his upcoming nuptials.  That business associate generously gave him a La Riqueza #3.  Finding it and the following two so enjoyable, Joe went out and bought a box of the La Riqueza #3's the very next day.  Most enjoyable for him are Medium to Full bodied smokes that offer a lot of complexity and flavor changes.Today, he reviews a Tatuaje J21 Reserva. Enjoy!If I can say one thing about Tatuaje, it is that they are very confident in their product.  Instead of relying on overly flashy bands and packaging, the cigars are allowed to do their own talking and the J21 does not stray.  The standard solid brown background, adorned with the Tatuaje signature and Fleur de Lys, is very unassuming.  The only indication that this is a unique smoke is the addition of a second \u201cReserva\u201d band, which adds some definition but is still remarkably simple.Having received this stick from a fellow BOTL who somehow managed to let this one sit for a while, I was not surprised to notice the buildup of plume on this cigar.  A very nice sheen presented itself on the surface of the wrapper due to the delicious oils coming forward.  A prominent smell of pepper came through when testing the foot.Construction for this smoke is pretty solid.  Observing the wrapper there were no flaws, with the only exception being one slightly prominent vein wrapping through the length of the cigar.  The seams were visible but essentially smooth and the edges only able to be seen when staring directly down the side along the foot.  My punch, although I am starting to get to the point of needing a new one, made a perfect hole and the pre-light draw was fantastic.  Those notes of pepper hinted at previously became more evident and a slight cinnamon flavor showed itself.Breaking out my torch lighter, I toasted the foot and soon had a strong ring of fire going with a nice straight burn.  Taking my first couple of puffs to get the toast evened out let loose a pepper BOMB!  The notes of pepper that I smelled and tasted pre-light did not prepare me for this.  A couple of puffs into this, however, and the pepper backed off just enough to allow an earthy flavor to come through.  This was very pleasant indeed because I am not sure how long I could have stood the strength of the pepper alone.At about the one inch mark the pepper blended into the overall balance of the smoke and caramel tones became apparent.  The light gray ash was very tight and held on for some time.The J21's flavor profile remained this way for about half of the smoke, with the pepper always being evident but fading in and out of the spotlight, sometimes letting its other cast mates have their turn.  It was during an ebb in the pepper that I noticed a distinct taste of pumpkin and spice, which may have been nutmeg.  Although the flavor (pepper vs coffee) and strength profiles are quite different, this is the same effect I noticed with a well aged Rocky Patel Vintage 1990 I smoked several months ago and one of the aspects that made it so enjoyable.The pepper, earth and spice took over for the majority of the last half of this smoke and I was more than happy to nub this one.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this smoke.  The draw was very tight and the burn sharp.  I found myself only having to relight the smoke, which I take all blame for due to distractedness.  The balanced profile made the entire stick enjoyable and the unique flavors kept me waiting to see what else would pop up.  I feel very fortunate to have gotten a well aged one for two reasons.  First, this was a very \u201cbig\u201d cigar because of the amount of pepper it contained.  Although I cannot speak to it, I feel as though a younger version of this might have the overall balance thrown off because of the pepper's dominance.  Second, it is very high in nicotine.  I was actually a little buzzed after finishing this one and it smoked for roughly 1.5 to 2 hours.  The aging likely reduced this some.  Despite this, go out and get a few of these.  Smoke one now and give the others some time in the humi.  To be safe, whether young or old, make sure to have them after a solid meal.  The $11.00 price point knocks it out of the everyday smoke range for many of us but it should be one that you try out if the opportunity presents itself.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (4.25)This post was written by Joe K.

Broadleaf Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : $6 eachMore info about purchasing La Aroma de Cuba cigars...Distributed by Ashton Cigar Company, the La Aroma de Cuba brand is now made by Pepin Garcia in Nicaragua (he already had ties with Ashton\u2019s San Cristobal and Benchmade brands).  The brand now consists of eleven vitolas including the Monarch that we previously reviewed.The pre-light ritual was not perfect for this cigar but pretty close.  Wrapper had a dark chocolate look complimented by an oily sheen and lots of veins.  Pre-light smell was easily identified as barnyard and hay with the easy flowing cold draw reinforcing the scents.  Cap was a lumpy triple seam however the band and piece of red fabric on the foot of the cigar made for a nice presentation (the cloth used to not be part of the packaging on this brand).The La Aroma de Cuba Robusto opened up full-bodied with loads of thick white smoke.  The draw on the cigar was effortless and just perfect.  Loads of cream and sweet chocolate were certainly present throughout the entire first third.  The aroma of creamy sweetness was also pleasantly relaxing.The second third of this robusto transitioned from chocolate to a cedar, woodsy tone.  The draw remained magnificent but the burn became a bit wavy at the start of the second third.  The ash proved to be a soft gray throughout the first half of this cigar.Into the last third of my La Aroma de Cuba robusto my palate was teased with dark coffee and the cream could still be detected until the end.  This cigar can be defined as a cool smoke and full bodied throughout.  In fact I appreciate the fact that it was a full-bodied experience without being overly harsh.I cannot say that I\u2019ve ever had a bad experience with the La Aroma de Cuba cigar brand.  This is another fine example of another great product from the Garcia family.  If you\u2019re looking for a defined flavor profile with lots of cream I highly recommend the La Aroma de Cuba Robusto.  For the price you\u2019ll never go wrong with this one!Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 8 pts. Overall Experience: 8 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

Said to be more mellow and  medium bodied than the brown label, the Havana VI line is comprised of eight different vitolas: Hermosos \u2013 5 5/8 x 46, Angeles \u2013 4 5/8 x 42, Victorias 6 x 38, Artistas \u2013 6 1/8 x 52 (reviewed here), Nobles \u2013 5 x 50 (reviewed here), Almirantes \u2013 7 x 47, Gorditos \u2013 5 \u00bd x 56, Verocu No.5 \u2013 4 x 40.Out of the entire Havana VI line, the only other sizes I\u2019ve tried are the Almirantes (Churchill), which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I was certainly excited to have the chance to sample a smaller vitola (Corona Especial), so let's see how it went.The pre-light ritual for the Tatuaje Havana VI Victorias proved to be mediocre.  The cigar had a wonderful milk chocolate wrapper, containing very few veins, and no blemishes/soft spots.  The cap was a very rough, triple seam, pigtail that was by no means impressive.The band contained little detail and was applied sloppily, with the overlap attachment not lining up.  The pre-light smell showed heavy hints of manure/barnyard and the cold draw had a great resistance that gave way to hints of wood and hay.The Tatuaje Havana VI Victorias opened with loads of black coffee and earthy flavors.  The absolutely perfect draw gave way to a thick, creamy, white smoke.  The aroma was also quite enjoyable, and reminded me of sweet cookie dough.  The cigar\u2019s profile showed signs of great aged tobacco throughout the entire first third.  Wonderful start!Halfway through the second third of my Havana VI Victorias the profile changed into chocolaty, espresso flavors with the earthy undertone still present.  The cigar continued to draw and burn great, while also keeping my palate moist and wanting more.With just the final third remaining, the only thing I could think of was how great this cigar had been thus far.  Don\u2019t worry; it didn\u2019t let me down in the final third.  Immediately beginning the final third the cigar turned spicy showing hints of black pepper accompanied by a woodsy, cedar sweetness.  This was most interesting and very enjoyable.  The draw did get a little tighter on the final stretch along with a mild \u201cflint\u201d like taste on the finish, however not enough to upset my overall experience with the cigar.Let me sum things up by saying\u2026 WOW!  I was truly blown away by how great of a cigar this is.  I will most definitely be adding these to my normal rotation, as they are box worthy.  The entire time the cigar had an amazing draw, burn, and flavor profile, leaving me wanting more.  I highly suggest any and all cigar aficionados try the Tatuaje Havana VI Victorias as you won\u2019t be disappointed.  Way to go Pete and Pepin!Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 9 pts.

He was creating a cigar in tribute to his father and he was doing it behind Pepin\u2019s back.  He managed to keep it a secret up until he was nearly finished with it and when Pepin found out about it he told his son to give him three cigars which he promptly smoked and loved.  That is the Birth Story of My Father Cigars.  The cigar is made up of tobacco from the Garcia\u2019s own farms for the binder and filler, and the wrapper is a lovely and oily Habano leaf grown in Ecuador by the Oliva Tobacco family.The My Father line of cigars is available in four sizes:In addition to these cigars there have been a couple of line extensions added to the brand including the My Father Cedros Deluxe and Le Bijou 1922.  The original My Father is a beautiful looking cigar with a large ornate band and a smooth and oily colorado claro wrapper.   The No. 3 Cremas is an interesting vitola because of the unique style of the head of the cigar.  It comes to a very short taper, almost like it was going to be a belicoso and then someone just stopped the taper and completed the cap.  The result is reminiscent of the fumas style nipple but in truth this is quite different from that.  I found I really like this style from both a look and feel perspective.  The slight taper was comfortable when smoking and it thought it was unique and pleasant looking.I found the cigar to be very pleasant and more mild than just about any other DPG smoke I\u2019ve tried.  There was lots of coffee bean and dry wood on the palate and the flavors had a creamy texture to them.  The aroma produced by the smoke was elegant, and floral.  The last third of the cigar was more robust with a mild spice and some leather and occasional flashes of black pepper.  The burn was impeccable and the draw perfect.  The ash was a little loose and flaky so I had to ash often, but otherwise I had no complaints for this excellent cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

A Candela wrapped Lancero.  I recently reviewed the Illusione ~88~ Candela which kindled a spark of interest for this wrapper that I largely ignored in the past.  Like I said in that review of the ~88~, Candela wrappers seemed to be reserved for use on bad cigars.  The regular Illusione ~hl~ sports a rosado wrapper and is probably my number one favorite Illusione cigar.  The standard ~hl~ is the definition of elegance and balance.  The Candela ~hl~ is a different animal.I don\u2019t know if the blend of this cigar was tweaked or just entirely different from the blend used for the standard Holy Lance but this green version tastes nothing like the original. The Candela is heavy on the palate with a strong spice.  The Candela wrapper imparts a crispness with a slight grassy note and a subtle sweetness that is almost completely overpowered by the spice and tobacco flavors.  The heaviness of the flavors is backed up by a fairly stout punch in the strength department.  I found the ~hl~ Candela to be a bit rough around the edges but still a really good robust smoke.  If you asked me to pick a favorite of the Candelas I think I\u2019d have to give the nod to the ~88~. One I will certainly enjoy again. Still, I thought the Lancero was excellent and offers a different Candela experience.  It is a cigar I will certainly enjoy again soon.  My Local just got a bunch of boxes in so I should be able to stay in good supply.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of the Illusione ~hl~ Claro/CandelaI\u2019m a big fan of Dion\u2019s products and was very interested to see how he would handle this wrapper, especially on my favorite size in his line, the ~hl~, AKA the Holy Lance.Now just about all Candela wrapped cigar are blended to be SUPER mild, and I was very surprised with my first puff of this cigar!  Tons of pepper and spice from the start!  What\u2019s neat is that I can still taste that \u201cgreen\u201d barnyard flavor common to candelas amidst all the pepper.One thing I notice right away is that the finish is not dry either.  I do get a touch of cinnamon on the finish as well.  It reminds me of Dentyne gum without the cloying quality.The burn is dead-on even and I get copious amounts of smoke with each puff.Further down, the pepper backs off and I start picking up a bit of mint.  I am wholly impressed with this cigar.  The last bit smokes like a dream, adding a  little coffee to the mix.When Dion does a limited release, he does it right (ECCJs anyone?)!  This is a special cigar I pray makes it into standard production!

We have been experiencing some fantastic weather lately (goodbye snow?) and I made a resolution to pick a great stick to usher in this beautiful day.  Running through an inventory of my desktop humidor, it hit me which stick I was craving.  I won a certain contest recently, involving the identification of famous moustaches.  The BOTL hosting it was very generous and one of the sticks I received from him was an Arturo Fuente Hemingway Work of Art Maduro.  So as the sun reached its zenith, I grabbed my supplies, set up camp in its warm glow and prepared to enjoy my first cigar from Fuente\u2019s Hemingway line.This cigar is one that has always caught my eye because of its unique figurado shape.  The foot is closed into a small nub known as a perfecto foot, which allows for easy lighting and encourages a straight burn.  Just past that point, the cigar boasts a ring gauge of 60.  The barrel is tapered towards the head of the cigar until it reaches a gauge of 46 and ends in a pointed cap.  Definitely an attention grabber, this cigar\u2019s shape has since been copied by several manufacturers.Holding the cigar up to the light, the dark maduro wrapper glistens from a significant level of oils.  Although the toothy texture gives the wrapper a rugged appearance, it seems well constructed.  There is one sizable vein that should not post a large problem but does make itself known.  Bringing the stick to eyelevel, the head meets my cutter\u2019s guillotine blades leaving behind an even slice with no hang-ups.Prelight, the only real flavors that I pick up on are tobacco and earth.  Excited to get this one started, I easily toast the end to get it underway; point perfecto foot.  The first puffs that come off of this one are extremely sweet.  Underneath that sweetness is that signature coffee flavor found in most of the maduros I have tried.  When these two flavors combine, it reminds me of a cup of coffee that someone has dumped far too much raw sugar into.  Personally, overly sweet flavors do not sit at all well with me and certainly detracts from the appeal.  This flavor profile remains for about half of an inch, where the gauge begins to taper and then the sweetness mellows out.  Thankfully, the coffee flavor is allowed to become more prominent and the sweet taste compliments rather than overpowers.From beginning to end, the burn is pretty straight.  The one vein that was present at the start did cause some unevenness to occur but rotating the cigar and moistening the faster burning area kept it on an even course.  Just at the halfway mark as the burn closed in on the 46 gauge point, a spiced flavor replaced the sweet.  For the remainder of this smoke the two gently seesawed back and forth with neither really overshadowing nor competing with the other.   The spice did finally take over during the last inch or so to finish this out.Overall, this was an enjoyable smoke.  The biggest thing that detracted from it was the overly potent in-your-face sweetness that started this cigar off.  The coffee and spice combined with the subtle sweetness was much more favorable in my opinion.  Also, the shape of the cigar takes the more mellow flavors that start the smoke and slowly blends them into a spicier profile towards the end leading to a more complex smoke than what might be available in a standard vitola, say a robusto.  In all honesty, the shape does also work quite hard at grabbing your attention.  With limited release on these, if you can get them at MSRP they are a pretty good buy but I would not pay much more over that.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

Regardless of the draw issues, the initial pulls produced a creamy, leathery taste along with some faint peppery spices. A few minutes in, this is accompanied by a rich, buttery flavor that seemed to stick around for the remainder of the smoke. About a third in, the peppery spices got a little stronger and the smoke turned to full, earthy flavors. The last half of the cigar bounced around with these earthy tones, to hints of chocolate and buttery cream. I really enjoyed the flavors of this cigar.Value :  At $12 a stick, this is a pricey smoke. I did not experience any draw problems with the torpedo and, if the stick I had was an anomaly, I could recommend purchasing some. However, my experience was marred by a horribly tight draw and, as such, I cannot in good faith recommend this smoke in its price range.Overall Rating :  Despite its draw problems, I did enjoy this cigar. It exhibited a wonderful flavor profile and was satisfying in that regard. However, the price, coupled with construction, knocks this stick down substantially, leaving it about average for me.

I would like to offer a few words.  I would like to clarify something in regards to stem paticles and how they relate to the TRUE entubado method of rolling a cigar.  Some have claimed to roll using entubado but in doing so they take the filler leaves and flatten them all together and then roll them all at once like a news paper and that is their version of entubado.  True entubado is actually taking each filler leaf and tubing it individually which is what we do.  It is very time consuming and you cannot make as many cigars which in turn increases labor cost.  In order to roll using True entubado you need enough of a piece of filler to roll it into a tube.  with some viso and almost all ligero, which are the smallest leaves on the plant except for the medio tiempo, you cannot do True entubado without using the whole leaf because it is too small to roll an adequate tube with only half.  The Recluse will start shipping to retailers around the country on or before October 1st.  We would invite you at your convenience to try a couple when they are released as the ones we sent you were rushed because we were excited and could not wait to get them to you and your other colleagues in the industry.", "Don Jose Raphael;"], "construction": " This cigar burned flawlessly.

According to the company\u2019s literature, Iconic Leaf Cigar was founded by two very well-known and well-respected legends in the cigar industry who have chosen to remain anonymous in their pursuit to make the very best premium boutique cigars that can be found anywhere in the world without the influence of their names.  Iconic Leaf Cigar\u2019s founders may have chosen to keep their identities private but their leader has not.  Led by J.R. Dominguez, son of legendary cigar maker Jose Dominguez, Iconic Leaf is extremely excited about their new line-up of cigars recently unveiled at the IPCPR trade show in Orlando.  According to the company, all tobacco leaf in the RECLUSE goes through EIGHT fermentation cycles and is a collection of what they deem to be \u201ctruly iconic leaf\u201d from around the world. The RECLUSE cigar selection is produced exclusively at the Leyendas Cubanas factory run by Don Jose Rafael.First, a little bit about the Recluse cigar straight from their website:The RECLUSE cigar is comprised of the absolute finest of everything. From the seed that is sown, to the blend of the tobacco leaves that make up this masterpiece, to the painstaking fermentation. Under the watchful eye of the maestro, Don Jose Rafael in the Leyendas Cubanas factory, each cigar goes through a Club Med for cigars, if you will. Each leaf is hand selected from only the finest tobacco leaves of the harvest. From the Flavorful and smooth Brazilian Maduro wrapper and Cameroon binder, to the specifically selected Dominican leaf variations in the filler, these cigars are what we believe to be the finest in the world. Each and every leaf in the RECLUSE goes through EIGHT fermentation cycles. Why? Because Don Jose Rafael will not settle for mediocrity. Every RECLUSE is rolled in the old Cuban tradition of tubing which is taking each filler leaf and rolling it into a tube instead of folding it. Once all the filler leaves are each individually rolled into a tube shape, they are brought together and surrounded with the binder. This is time consuming but creates an effortless draw and an unparalleled smoking experience. We then box press each cigar to compress the leaf and reduce air space. This spotlights the flavors of the blend and creates a slower burn while delivering an exceptional draw. The RECLUSE line is offered in ten box pressed sizes.Having been sent a couple of unbanded Toros to sample, I wanted to be fair to the company so I let them sit in my humidor for a couple of weeks to stabilize and acclimate themselves following the shipping.  I was eagerly awaiting the opportunity to taste one and last night decided that the Recluse would be my cigar of choice. Pictures of the bands, provided by the company, can be seen in the attached images. I chose to smoke my sample with a straight cut.Appearance :  This cigar is a 6.25 x 50 box-pressed toro. The sample photographed is the actual cigar I smoked for this review. It has a beautiful oily Brazilian maduro wrapper. The seams were visible and the wrapper had some thick visible veins. The cap looked a tad sloppily applied. The Recluse was firm to the touch with no noticeable soft spots. Its pre-light aroma was a very pleasing woodsy/cocoa and the foot had a very pleasing natural tobacco/woodsy scent.  The box press makes the cigar\u2019s stated 50 ring gauge appear smaller.  It felt firm in my hands and was very comfortable to hold and smoke.Construction :  This cigar burned flawlessly. Not once did I need to correct the burn and, more importantly, I never had to re-light it. If the burn wavered now and then it was very short-lived and corrected itself almost as quickly as it went wonky. The Recluse provided clouds of thick white smoke. The ash was firm, white and only occasionally was there any flaking. The draw was effortless and remained so during the entire duration of the smoke. The deduction was for stem particles I noticed in my cigar when I snipped the cap off that you can see in the photo below.  Although they did not impact the draw or burn, seeing any stem particles in my cigars is unacceptable for me.Flavor :  I was hit with spice and cocoa on lighting the cigar. There were hints of oak and earth. The cigar let off a very pleasing velvety, caramelized smoke.  Let us not mistake the spice for peppery spice for it is certainly not.  The spice is best described as a cayenne-like heat. At times it was overpowering, however at the outset it was mild enough to be tolerable and went well with the velvety cocoa, leather and woodsy flavors I was getting from the cigar. Caramel, cocoa, leather with woodsy hints were the predominant flavors in the first third. The finish was long thanks to the spice.  The spice would remain at the top of my mouth and at the back of my throat from puff to puff, never really leaving.The volume of smoke seemed to intensify as I smoked it. Nice thick clouds of white smoke with a firm ash and even burn. I like voluminous smoke with my cigar and this one does not disappoint in that regard.  The smoke was made all the more enjoyable because of its velvety/oily texture.As I started the second third I started to pick up hints of salt on my lips that helped to balance the sweet cocoa notes.  The finish was shorter than the first third as some of the overpowering spice I encountered in the first third subsided. As I neared the middle of the cigar I picked up hints of dark, bitter chocolate and unsweetened espresso.  This bitterness did not last long though but was strong enough to leave an unfavourable impression.  Thankfully this bitterness quickly evolved into a a toasted nuttiness.  I continued to pick up woodsy, leathery notes.  As I approached the end of the second third some of the spice that had decreased earlier started to re-emerge.The slight salty hint on my palate remained as I started the final third and the finish became longer thanks to the re-emergence of that spice. The cayenne-like heat returned and lingered on my pallet right about the time I started to feel the nicotine. The spice  helped to lengthen the finish but admittedly at times this spice was a tad too much for my taste.  Woodsy notes with aromatic cocoa were the predominant flavors.  The bitterness that crept in at the centre of the cigar never returned.As I neared the middle of the final third the cigar gave me hints of semi-sweet chocolate, caramel and oak with a very pleasing natural tobacco flavor. The aforementioned cayenne like spice intensified. The finish remained long, the spice remained very noticeable and at times was overwhelming and distracting. I feel like some of that spice masked some of the flavors.  At times I could not pick up any discernable flavors because I was battling the spice.  The final third provided the most intense flavors and when the spicy notes weren't getting in the way the flavors were pleasant.Wood, leather and spicy cocoa with hints of caramel and coffee were my lasting impressions of this well-constructed cigar. I loved its smoke output.This cigar was certainly complex. If it had a drawback for me it was that at times the flavors were very muted while at other times the spice was a tad overwhelming and distracting. It didn't have that nice flow I look for in a complex cigar.  However, it certainly had enough of a variety of flavors going on and Iconic Leaf must be commended for putting together a very well built cigar with enough of a flavor profile to keep my interest.I put the cigar to rest with approximately 2 inches remaining because the spice became too overpowering. Had it not been for the spice, I would most probably have smoked this down to the nub.Overall strength was medium with the flavor profile being complex and medium to full-bodied.Although the cigar was a pleasure to smoke, deductions were made for the at times overwhelming spice, the fact that there were times when the cigar exhibited almost no flavor, for the mediocre flavor transitions.  When the flavor was on however, it was \u201con\u201d and made for a very enjoyable smoke indeed.Value :  Remember, I did not pay for this cigar, however the company confirmed with me that their suggested MSRP for the Recluse Toro is $7.80 per cigar and at that price, this cigar offers exceptional value for the quality of the smoke. It certainly does not command the \u201cboutique\u201d cigar prices out there today and in blind tastings can give many other more expensive maduros from more familiar names in the industry a run for their money.

The peppery spice died down soon afterwards, but little bits remain clung to the back of my tongue. The initial flavors are leather, toast, wood, a touch of menthol, and pepper still. The smoke was very drying, not sweet, more savory, and made me very thirsty. Dipping into the second third of the cigar, the smoke has powered up and tastes more and more toastiness. Some very faint coconut/macadamia, bread toast, and woody flavors are present. Up until now, the flavors profile has diminished more and more. The last third is where I started to get really let down. The flavors dropped off completely and I was met only by residual woodsiness/toast commencing in bleh! The profile overall was medium to full bodied.Value :  It is very hard to peg the value on this cigar, since it is so rare. I know these cigars were, or maybe are still, highly desirable since they followed the epic release of the corona gorda jar release. But given my smoking experience with these recently, I would never go out of my way to find these.Overall Rating :  (2.75) The cigar had some decent flavors in the first two-thirds, and in its last third left me pretty disappointed. It is difficult to say that these may need more aging, because the underlying flavors underneath all the spiciness isn\u2019t there. If I was going to peg the evolution of this cigar, I would say they are past their prime. This is rare due to the fact that Tatuajes are reknowned for their aging capabilities. But all in all, the lack of balance in this stick, I\u2019m afraid, points only towards a downhill spiral from here on out.This post was written by Aaron.

He sent over a nice package of sticks that contained a Cuban music CD along with a bevy of other publication material. In one of the largest releases of new cigars in recent pasts at IPCPR, this cigar was the one that spoke out the most to me. The sheer extent of detail orientation it took to make this cigar was quite amazing.We start with 100% Cuban seeds and raise our tobacco in what we consider the only place on earth that literally replicates the famous Pinar del Rio tobacco-growing region of Cuba. Our research resulted in a small valley located in Ecuador, where the soil content, the daily temperatures, and the atmospheric conditions all combine to deliver a tobacco leaf that we feel mirrors identically (to Cuban tobacco). Additionally, our entire production process is being overseen and managed by highly skilled Cuban tobacco professionals. Even our rollers are Cubans, who are on special visas from Cuba, working in our own factory located only an hour-long plane ride from Cuba. Each has been trained in the great tobacco factories of Havana, to be the finest torcedores in the industry, and now they roll cigars exclusively for us.These cigars are packaged in beautiful boxes that rival no other on the market. The bright red boxes are felt bottomed and produced by the same box makers that make the Behike boxes for Cohiba. So far there are two different blends of Buena Vista cigars: the Edicion Limitada 2008 (Ecuadorian puro), and Reserva (Ecuadorian and Dominican blend). I\u2019ve heard the Reserva is the lighter of the two blends. There are 9 different vitolas for the different blends. That is unheard of for a new cigar company. I received the Short Churchill and Prominentes vitolas in my package coming from Gary. I smoked the Short Churchill one day off the delivery truck, then the other about a week afterwards. I smoked the Prominentes approximately a month later for this review. I want to say thank you to Gary for providing these beautiful cigars for us to review.Appearance :  Hell, Cubans don\u2019t even have this kind of appearance (except for the Behikes).

The short churchills didn\u2019t require any at all. The salt and pepper ash holds on firmly for 2-3 inches at a time.Flavor :  The post-light flavors are very inviting and familiar to any Cuban cigar smoker. Marzipan, sweet hay, vanilla, and a touch of leather characterize much of the 1st third of the cigar. A citrus-like twang is also noticeable in this 1st third. Not really any kind of spice noted. A medium minus is my feeling of where the body of the cigar lies.The flavors do not hit you in the face but are somewhat subdued. The balance within the smoking experience is remarkable though, but I wish that the flavors would explode more. Into the 2nd third the flavor profile transitions to a more creamy nut and cedar flavor.The last third sees an elevation in the body of the cigar to a solid medium. Chocolate and graham mix in with creamy nuttiness to start off the last part of the cigar. Finishes with a waxy/marzipan/butter flavor.Value :  Now this is the category that will most likely pose problems for most smokers.

For a huge Batman geek like myself, that\u2019s a great thing. And I hate to say it, but that alone would get me to buy this cigar. I know, I know. I\u2019m the first one to preach about not getting sucked into marketing schemes, but I guess we\u2019ll always be victims once in a while.On the sniffles, the very dark and oily wrapper gave off a caramel chocolate and cedar smell. (It does come wrapped in a sheet of cedar) The foot smells very woody and on the pre-draw I picked up some more chocolate, but with a tea bag aftertaste behind it. Finding flavors and scents before the smoke is always a good thing. Perhaps I'm in for a good cigar?The first puffs taste like a sweet leather and light chocolate ice cream sundae. And don\u2019t forget to ask for some nuts because there\u2019s plenty of it in the first third. I say \u201csundae\u201d because there\u2019s a ice cream like aftertaste to this cigar. It\u2019s very light and very soft on the palate, but still leaves plenty of flavors in your mouth. It almost reminds me of the Dark Sumatra but a very creamy, vanilla style Dark Sumatra.From the half way point to the end of the cigar, it\u2019s the same. Lots more chocolate, but this time more of a roasted undertone and a lot more leather, less sweet and more richer leather. Some pepper action once in a while, but nothing major. It\u2019s a very soft pepper that only remains on the aftertaste. By the end of the cigar, you can define the flavor profile as your typical maduro flavors, but with a softer tone and with a little bit more sweetness.The burn was great, the draw was fantastic and the aroma will cloud up your favorite smoking room. On top of that, the soldiers are lined up and ready for war with a \u201csugar army ash\u201d. Including this cigar, I've smoked about 10 Hoyo De Monterreys and each one has been excellent when it comes to quality and construction.If you\u2019re a fan of maduro cigars, i think you will enjoy this cigar very much. For the mild smokers who are looking for a \u201cnot-so-strong\u201d maduro, this ones for you. It\u2019s a really good cigar with a solid consistent flavor profile. I definitely recommend it.Final Note: Being a big Dark Sumatra fan, I'm really happy to know this cigar is just as good. If you're on the same boat like my buddy Brian Hewitt and myself, who both love the Dark Sumatra. I think the Dark Knight can be smoked during the day and the Dark Sumatra at night.

The Padilla Signature 1932 is Ernesto Padilla\u2019s tribute to his late father, the Cuban poet Heberto Padilla. The Keepers of the Flame have a great profile of Heberto that is very interesting and worth the read. Be sure to go check it out. Just click Heberto\u2019s name above. Ernesto trusted the making of this blend to none other than the greatest cigar maker of the current age, Don Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia.This cigar sports a dark brown, veiny corojo wrapper that has the look of leather. That combined with an ornate band with earth tones and gold trim gives this smoke a rustic yet very elegant look. The overall effect makes the cigar look vintage. Aesthetically it is an absolutely beautiful cigar. Its beauty doesn\u2019t stop at its appearance. The flavors are beautiful as well. After a typical \u201cPepin Pepper\u201d start the cigar makes a full on assault of your palate with robust flavors of leather and spice with a very earthy undertone. There is also a creaminess to the flavors that reminded me a bit of some of the Tatuaje Reserva cigars I\u2019ve smoked, also made by Pepin Garcia. I smoked this cigar outside on a beautiful sunny day and I noticed something about this cigar that I didn\u2019t see until I stepped out into the sunlight. When the sun hit the cigar it began to shimmer and sparkle. A closer look revealed a light dusting of crystals all over the wrapper. Plume! It was a pleasant surprise. As I passed the halfway mark it mellowed out a little. It was very woodsy/cedary and not as full bodied as it was at the start, but still a full flavored robust smoke. The construction was superb and the burn was great. The only negative thing I can say about it is that you can\u2019t put it down. I don\u2019t mean that in the sense that \u201cit\u2019s so good I can\u2019t put it down\u201d although that statement would apply to this cigar. Rather I mean you can\u2019t put it down because it will go out. I had to relight it a few times because it wouldn\u2019t stay lit if I stopped smoking it. The ash was mostly white peppered with black spots and it was a little papery on the edges.The Signature 1932 is an excellent smoke and a wonderful tribute to a great poet and father. I know Ernesto must be awfully proud of this cigar. I rate it as a must try for anyone who enjoys a robust, complex smoke.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Hand-Made Price : $100 per boxI've received a couple of La Flor de Cuba Maduro Robusto from JFC Tobacco Corp, a company based in Puerto Rica that seems to be mostly producing flavored cigars and rolling paper to roll your own sticks (!). La Flor de Cuba is dubbed as a full-bodied, strong cigar, designed for the American smoker. Although I have never heard of the brand and I couldn't find much info online, according to JFC it recently celebrated its 40th anniversary.Appearance :  This is a good-looking robusto. Under the toothy maduro wrapper with thin but visible veins one can find a blend of five different tobaccos from Brazil and Nicaragua among other countries. My only reproach is that the band lacks personality, I have the impression that I've already seen something similar several times.Construction :  Both samples behaved very well in a calm environment. The burn line was more than satisfying and the draw, that some people may find too open, was just as good.Flavor :  Unlit, the cigar smells of cedar (it was stored in a cedar sleeve), there's also some delicious sourness near the foot. The generous pre-draw is spicy. I proceed to toast the foot and bam! Indeed, this cigar is quite powerful! I wouldn't recommend smoking it on an empty stomach, unless you like taking chances. Even after a spicy Thai meal, the 1st third pepper is more than perceptible, pleasantly complementing the subtle sweetness. This sweetness is quite different from what I am used to encounter in some maduros, it's really delicate and not sugary at all. In the second third, La Flor de Cuba settles down in terms of spice but not in terms of power. It's full-bodied and the main flavors are leather and, as we approach the end, oak.Value :  I don't have the exact price for this line, but from what I understand they can be bought at $100 per box (on the other hand, I don't know how many cigars there are in such a box - 25, 24, 20?). In any case, at ~$5 per stick that's a pretty solid value if you enjoy strong maduro cigars.Overall Rating :  I would like to thank Paola for sending these cigars to me. This is the first time I had a cigar rolled in Puerto Rico and it was a pretty good experience.

He asked if I had heard of and/or tried any of his cigars.  He also asked if I\u2019d be interested in trying them if I hadn\u2019t.  I informed Paul that while I had indeed heard of his cigars, I hadn\u2019t yet had the pleasure of trying any of them.  He generously offered to remedy that and he sent me a sampler of his cigars.The Flatbed Cigar Company is based in Bucks County, Pennsylvania and they make Panacea Cigars.  There are currently three lines of Panacea cigars.  The names are simple and direct and make it easy to know which cigars are which.  They are simply named after the color of their bands.  There is the Panacea Black which comes in a shade-grown and maduro variety.  The Panacea Red is a bolder blend which sports a Maduro wrapper around a Dominican grown Habano binder.  Last but not least is the Flatbed Cigar Companies signature cigar, the Panacea Green which is finished off with a one of a kind Pennsylvania grown broadleaf wrapper.  I will be reviewing each of these cigars in the coming weekes so there will be plenty of details to follow on each of these.  Their very first cigar to market however was the Panacea Black Natural so I will be starting with this cigar first.  Before we get into the smoke, here is just a bit more on the company behind it.I won\u2019t be able to tell their story better than they can so I recommend checking out their website to learn all about them.  Just click here to read the story on how the Flatbed Cigar Company got started and what they are about.  I will give you the highlights here though.  They got started in 2007 with the Panacea Black.  The company was founded on the philosophy that they would focus on a few really good blends and use the best tobacco they could.  No gimmicks, no tricks, no fancy packaging.  Just good cigars made with good tobacco that hasn\u2019t been messed with.  The cigars are made in the Dominican Republic, and Paul started off selling them out of the trunk of his car driving all over the northeast and mid-Atlantic building his client base.  Pennsylvania has a rich tradition in the cigar industry and the Flatbed Cigar Company pays homage to that history with their Pennsylvanian grown wrapper that they use on the Panacea Green Label cigars.  The Green Label was a project that was a long time in the making that marries their heritage with their product.As I mentioned earlier the Panacea Black was the Flatbed Cigar Companie's very first cigar to market.  It is a blend of Dominican and Nicaraguan tobacco wrapped in a dusky Ecuadorian grown, Connecticut Shade wrapper. This perfecto is very unique.  I originally mistook it for a torpedo with an unusual tapered foot.   I recently realized my mistake and updated this post.  It isn\u2019t your typical perfecto because the taper is only at the head and foot of the stogie.  The body of the stick is straight like a standard parejo vitola.  It\u2019s shape is unique and unusual which makes it interesting to me.  The cigar has an aroma of hay and tobacco and the draw seems to be just right.This mild smoke starts off very nicely with creamy flavors like butter and nuts as well as some paper and hay notes.  All very typical of a a Connecticut shade wrapped cigar.  Not typical was the complete lack of harshness or youth.  The flavors while mild were well-defined and balanced.  It is consistent from start to finish.  Near the center there was the addition of some earthiness, and a bit of a barnyard? (hay and earth) aroma and in the last third there was some spice and black pepper that joined the party.  The burn, while not razor-sharp, was always even and demanded no attention from me which is the way I like it.  They claim to have the best rollers making their cigars and my sample lived up to that claim.  It was very well made.I admit I have a soft spot for small boutique cigar brands, so I also have to confess that I really wanted to like this cigar going in.  I had concerns, because in my opinion there are a lot of sub-par Connecticut Shade cigars out there and not many that I find to be good.  I had no idea what to expect from the Panacea but was very pleasantly surprised by it.  I found it be a very tasty, very well made, mild smoke that was really excellent from start to finish.  It would be a great morning smoke with a cup of coffee or even serve as a nice easy going mid-day smoke.  This one has me really looking forward to trying the other Panacea samples I have waiting for me.  If you\u2019d like to give them a try, you can either look for a shop local to you that carries these cigars or order them direct online from the Flatbed Cigar Company.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Available in a rich maduro or a spicy corojo, Patel aimed to blend the smooth flavor of his Vintage series with the power of the Edge line. Originally labeled \"Master Blend 7XX,\" the Olde World was first introduced at the RTDA show (now IPCPR) in 2005, but wasn't released until the next year after being reintroduced at the 2006 RTDA show. Originally they were only available in boxes of 25, but now are available in boxes of 50. Today we're looking at the Corojo blend.Pre-light: Milk chocolate colored wrapper with very few veins and one visible seam on this nicely box pressed stogie. The cap is somewhat rough but perfectly applied to the head. A dark brown band with gold leaf logo and tobacco flowers. Very nice looking band, classy. What looks to be a paper wrapper with the Rocky Patel logo adorns the bottom half of the cigar, but it's actually compressed bits of leftover tobacco. The stick is firm throughout, with just a bit of give at the foot. Cutting the head with my Palio takes a bit of extra effort, but comes off perfectly. The pre-light draw is firm. The nose at the foot is nice and chocolatey.First third: I use my table lighter to warm the foot, and get a nice glowing ring at the edge. I put the OWR to my lips, and get the cigar going in a few puffs. Light, ethereal smoke drifts from the foot, and fills the mouth on the first draw. I'm immediately hit with chocolate and nut flavors, plus a bit of white pepper. The draw is nice, with just a touch of resistance to it. Firm, light gray ash. Dark ring at the burn line. Nice tight concentric circles in the ash. I drop the ash after 1 1/2\".Second third: The chocolate and nut flavors fade as I reach the middle, and are replaced by oak and black pepper. The excellent burn and firm ash continue, and the amount of smoke on the draw increases. Strength is starting to build up.Last third: The strength continues to build, and the pepper starts to really ramp up, overshadowing the wood flavors. The spice is definitely the number 1 flavor now. It's almost to the point of being unpleasant. Construction remains excellent to the end.Final thoughts: This stick starts out nice and medium-bodied then ends as a spicy full-bodied powerhouse. For a robusto, it burned a long time with a total smoking time of over 90 minutes. No complaints on the construction. If you're a big fan of corojo, this is an excellent choice.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/rocky-patel-olde-world1.jpg?iv=16"}, "grand cru": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Grand Corona Size : 6 3/32 x 43 Wrapper : USA Connecticut Shade Filler : Dominican Republic Binder : Dominican Republic Hand-Made Price : $15 eachMore info about purchasing Davidoff Grand Cru cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "davidoff", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["This is a truly magnificent cigar.

As far as I remember, I read somewhere that this brand is among the top 5 best-selling cigar brands in the United States.  As most of us are aware of, Davidoff cigars carry a large price tag in comparison to other competitor brands.  Lets see how the Grand Cru No. 1 measures up to the test.The pre-light ceremony for the Davidoff Grand Cru No.1 was outstanding.  The golden brown, sand colored wrapper was covered with lots of smooth veins.The band was an elegant creamy off white with gold lettering and the smell gave way to barnyard and dry hay. Pre-light, cold draw was sweet and spicy and gave a perfect resistance.The opening notes showed a sweet toastyness that was accompanied by lots of lush white smoke and the settling aroma was a coffee/cappuccino.The Davidoff Grand Cru No. 1 had an impeccably straight burn with a wonderful gray ash.  The cigar was burning fast, however, I was mostly paying attention to the delicious blast of sweet butter that covered my palate at the end of the first third.About half way through my Davidoff Grand Cru No.1 the sweet buttery goodness turned into rich dark chocolate with hints of cabernet.  This cigar was most certainly thus far an absolute pleasure to smoke and would be classified as medium bodied.The beginning of the final third showed hints of vinegar which was a little less pleasing, but it soon smoothed out and revisited that toastyness I experienced at the beginning.  The end of the final third really hit the spot with woody and honey notes on my palate.  Wow!  This along with the pristine burn and draw made this cigar a real treat.In the past I have not had great experiences with the Davidoff brand however the Grand Cru No. 1 hit a grand slam.  I would most certainly pay the heavy price tag for this cigar again and highly suggest it to those who may have not given it a chance.  It truly is a fantastic experience!Pre-Light: 9 pts.

The pre-light draw was just as nice as the post. There were no issues with burn. The initial ash lasted well over an inch, which was followed up almost to a \u201ct\u201d with the second, final ash.Flavor :  Pick this cigar up and smell the foot. Awesome!! This Padron had a terrific, full tobacco smell... with a hint of barnyard. The first third of this smoke was full of hickory wood and peppery spice, with a beautiful, evenly burning ash. Almost immediately, you notice that this is a strong and full-bodied stick, but not to a negative... it was just right. About an inch in, I noticed a subtle chocolaty sweetness... pure delight!The second third turned into a creamy sensation, with a nice coffee taste that slowly turned spicy into the final third of the smoke. I thought the last portions were fantastic! There were nice earthy tones to go along with the peppery spices. Close to the end tastes of parched nuts started to prevail, leaving me truly sad that I could no longer hold onto the stick.Value :  Value is my only knock on this cigar. At $17 or so a stick it is definitely well-placed in the super premium range. However, you get what you pay for, right? In this case... absolutely!I took one star away in this category only because there are some mighty close sticks in the sub-$10 range.  One off the top of my head is the Ashton VSG Illusion. The Ashton VSG doesn\u2019t carry the strength of this smoke, but it\u2019s certainly close enough in flavor and strength to be a formidable opponent, at almost half the price. Regardless, the fact remains that this belicoso exhibits all the character a connoisseur could possible desire.Overall Rating :  This stogie not only lives up to the hype, but ditches it at the door.

The two cigars are the Viaje White Label Project Candela and Illusione\u2019s 88 Candela. What makes this match up even more interesting is that both cigars come out of the same factory. For a lot of people out there this may be a problem, especially for those loyal to their brands and they don\u2019t like the fact that the factory allowed two candelas to leave its doors. Some even have gone as far as to say that Andre Farkas of Viaje is following (or copying) the lead of Dion Giolito. But the only question to myself, was which one of the cigars was better? So whose cigar is King of the Candela?I can\u2019t even begin to think that this matchup was close. I can easily say this war was won by a landslide victory by Dion\u2019s 88 Candela. The darker, bolder, and more brooding flavors of the filler of the 88 complemented the candela wrapper and made up for the okay flavors that candela wrappers offer. The WLP Summerfest blend tends to taste like paper or wet cardboard and doesn\u2019t seem to offer any decent flavors to complement the candela wrapper. Both are superbly made which is characteristic of Raices Cubanas, but the WLP Candela seemed to perform worlds above the 88 candela in the burn category.  But unfortunately this is its only great attribute, and forces me to give up the crown to Illusione 88 Candela as the King of Candela.(Notes: Smoked the 88 Candela first, then the Viaje second the first day. I smoked them again in reverse order the second day.

In 2009 #2 The Drac, a dark torpedo in a shiny black coffin was released to an absolute frenzy of fans trying to get ahold of the very limited cigar.  2009 also marked the first edition of the Monster \u201cOut-of-Costume\u201d Series of cigars.  This first edition is a Churchill called Boris, named after the actor Boris Karloff who made Frankenstein\u2019s Monster famous in his portrayal of the role in the classic 1931 film Frankenstein.  It is a very clever marketing scheme that I think is a lot of fun.Pete Johnson may not be finding it as fun as he had envisioned.  The limited nature of the cigars and the resulting difficulty in obtaining these cigars have caused Pete to be bombarded by complaints by frustrated and angry customers and tobacconists. It is a shame I think.  People seem to lose perspective and they get angry over something that they should not be angry about.  They are limited cigars and not everyone will be able to get them every time.  I really wanted a box of the Dracs.  I was lucky enough to get a box of the Franks in 2008 and hoped to add the Dracs to my collection.  I wasn\u2019t so lucky this time and I did not get a box.  In fact I didn\u2019t get any initially.  The only reason I have two of the Dracs in my humidor now was that I had a friend who was lucky enough to get some and was willing to trade for a couple with me.  I didn\u2019t write an angry letter to Tatuaje cigars.  That\u2019s just the way it goes, the nature of a highly sought after limited edition cigar.  I hope peoples\u2019 unreasonable anger doesn\u2019t discourage Pete from continuing with this fun and unique series of cigars.While I had to go the trade route for my Dracs, I did manage to purchase a couple of the Boris from my local cigar retailer, Empire Cigars. The Boris was cleverly thought out keeping with the motif of the series.  It is slightly shorter than the Frank and it is not box pressed, the idea being this cigar represents the actor Boris when he was out of his monster costume.  Like I said, very clever and well thought out.This is probably the most unique Tatuaje I have smoked.  It is completely unlike any other Tatuaje I\u2019ve tried and unlike any Pepin Garcia smoke I can think of as well.  Completely absent of any black pepper notes, this cigar has a very unique and very distinctive sweetness to it that is present from the first puff to the last.  It is a full flavored though not very strong cigar.  Complimenting the remarkable sweetness of the cigar are creamy notes of almond and espresso.  There were occasional flashes of leather  on the finish.Overall it was a smooth, creamy, and flavorful smoke. Excellent from start to finish.  The natural question is how does it rate compared to its costumed counterpart The Frank?  I have to say my personal preference is for the Frank.  But to use an analogy to clarify, that is like me saying I prefer a 16oz aged black angus filet over an 10oz cut.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

A very smooth, nice in color with no veins, healthy wrapper. It\u2019s still oddly shaped (I guess I was hoping for a corona gorda) and it's still eye catching. Again, it's one of the most eye doodling cigars in the market.Oh boy, this cigar smells amazing! I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just the one I have today, but it's really nice. On the smell, it's nothing but rich tobacco with a sugary-woodsy-tea like smell all around the cigar. Seriously, take a second and just give it a good sniffle action, it's worth it. The draw check was excellent, but left some spiciness on the lips, not what I like.To my surprise the Nub Cameroon does not start with the peppery/spicy flavors I thought it would. Instead it starts off really good and flavorful with lots of dark flavors. To me it\u2019s like a roasted smoky wood with some coffee beans followed by full body strength. As I reached toward the middle of the smoke, there\u2019s still rich dark flavors, very heavy on the palate, but not harsh at all. It\u2019s just a heavy dose of smoke that will cover your entire palate. It\u2019s not a complex cigar at all, there\u2019s nothing \u201cwow\u201d about the flavors, but it\u2019s consistent with the dark smoky/roasted flavor profile that sticks around to the end. No complaints, it was a decent flavor profile and it delivered what it had to offer.The first third gave me a problem with the burn, but it then fixed itself and remained perfect throughout the entire cigar. There wasn\u2019t much aroma found and the draw remained excellent. It\u2019s a well-made cigar.The Nub Cameroon is a pretty good cigar with lots of strength and lots of dark flavors on the aftertaste and palate. If you\u2019re a fan of the \u201cCameroon\u201d taste, I think it will suit you really well. Personally, I don\u2019t have any plans in smoking this cigar again, but if I had the chance to pick which Nub I would want from a plate of cigars, it would be the Connecticut.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

I thought, OK let's smoke one and see how they are doing.  I still have the better half of my box left (you can read my initial review of The Frank here).  I\u2019m glad I picked the box I did because my Franks are certainly not in a decline.  They are smoking wonderfully.  True they have lost a bit of their oomph, and a little bit of the spice they had when they were newborns but these dark double coronas still have plenty to offer me.  They still start off with a blast of pepper but perhaps not the full on punch in the palate that it once was.  It also still has plenty of the \u201csun grown twang\u201d that I love from sun grown broadleaf wrappers.  The black pepper and spices are much more subtle now and the coffee and cocoa flavors are more prevelant and I was occasionally getting an nutty, almost almond like flavor from it from time to time.I can\u2019t say if these cigars will decline, maintain, or improve as time goes on.  I just don\u2019t know.  I do know that right now they are fantastic.  I think they are even better now than they were when they first came out.  That is saying something because they were fantastic fresh.  So given this most recent experience with a nicely aged version of The Frank,  I am not sure how much longer these will last in my humidor so I probably won\u2019t have to worry about how they will continue to age.  They probably won\u2019t have an opportunity to do so for much longer. Perhaps then, the discussion board warning still has had its intended effect, to get me to smoke my Franks\u2026This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It reminds me a lot of the J. Fuego Sangre de Toro but without the peppery spice. It was noticeable that this cigar burns very quickly and I was done with the first third within 15 minutes.

At this point, the cigar has definitely hit a bland spot for me. Some yeasty bread notes do find their way of weaving in and out of the last part of this third though and I am having trouble deciding whether I like it or not.3rd Third: The toasted wood notes continue into the last part of the cigar. There is a weird chemical, sour note that I don't like that appears every now and then as well.  Some of the sweetness that had left in the first third has made a triumphant return, thankfully, to balance out some of the unsavoriness of this last part of the Seduction.

He was able to attend IPCPR this year and was fortunate enough to pickup a few extra sticks to share with me. A local talk radio personality and newspaper columnist, Mike Rosen, has a poignant phrase. \"Let me tell you where I sit before I tell you where I stand.\" Essentially this is an effort at full disclosure so listeners and readers will know of any personal biases he may have about a topic of discussion. This statement has been on my mind since late last week when I was approached by Cigar Inspector to do a series of CAO reviews for his site. Being a fan of CAO, I jumped at the opportunity to toot the horn of my personal favorite cigar manufacturer. Although I have a personal bias towards CAO, I do take cigar reviews very seriously. It's of no benefit to anyone for me to rate a cigar higher just because I want it to have a better rating. In the end the cigars will speak for themselves, your tastes will differ from mine and I'm not trying to persuade you to my side of the street. I only hope this series of reviews will remind you of some of your favorite (or soon to become favorite) CAO cigars, will inspire you to try a new blend you haven't yet or revisit one that may have disappointed you in the past.So now that you know where I sit (I love CAO cigars), here's where I stand on one of the newest lines from CAO, the Gold Vintage Cr\u00e9mant:Appearance :  The Gold Vintage Cr\u00e9mant has an elegant and creamy light tan Ecuadorian Connecticut Seed wrapper from the \"banner harvest\" of 2004.

Even though my tastes have moved away from Maduros, I still find myself craving one every now and then. I knew I\u2019d be smoking this 5 Vegas Series A this month, but I have been trying to hold off until one of those Maduro cravings hit.\u00a0I brought this cigar with me to the beach this weekend just in case the mood struck and when I opened my Otterbox and saw it sitting there I though to myself, \u201cThis is a good spot for a Maduro.\u201dThe 5 Vegas Series A is a good looking smoke.\u00a0 Besides a beautiful, very toothy and rich looking dark brown wrapper, the cigar is dressed to the nines.\u00a0 Sporting a very elegant (if a bit large) black and gold band, it\u2019s modesty is protected by a large cedar sleeve that hides the majority of its length.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t find much information about the makeup of this cigar.\u00a0 Just that it has a Costa Rican Maduro wrapper and a three country blend filler.The 5 Vegas Series A Archetype has a rich earthy aroma that some might find intimidating, but in truth the cigar is fairly easy going, medium-bodied with a short finish. The Archetype started off with a very harsh blast to my palate which was a little off putting.\u00a0 After that initial blast it settled down quite a bit.\u00a0 It has a meaty maduro flavor with a hint of dark chocolate but the flavors were a bit muddled. Like most maduros there was a slight sweetness to it especially on the lips. As I progressed passed the half way mark there was bit more leather and earth but the flavors still seemed muddy and muted.\u00a0 I also began to detect a slightly metallic aftertaste on the finish.\u00a0 I am a fan of the 5 Vegas Classic and the Gold, but the series A has never really done much to impress me in any of the vitolas I\u2019ve tried and the Archetype is no different.\u00a0 It\u2019s a decent smoke and since the price point on these is a bit of a bargain, it\u2019s not bad for a day on the links or working in the yard.

Robert Spoden does not make use of a sales force, and, other than their website, Bucanero does not advertise anywhere which results in quality cigars which are extremely affordable.Bucanero Cigars is known as the \"best of the best\" in limited production cigar manufacturing awarded as such in 1999 as the Top 5 Limited Production Cigar Manufacture of the 20th Century Worldwide. Out of 774 cigar manufactures worldwide, the Cigar Industry Review Panel (1999) selected Bucanero Cigars as \"Best of the Best\" in limited production cigars [information from the Bucanero Cigar website].This review features the Bucanero Don Douglas Cabinet Series Churchill.  This cigar was rated \u201cExcellent\u201d in Smoke Magazine.Appearance :  This cigar features two large veins running the length of the cigar.  The natural wrapper can be described as caramel or toffee in color.  The band can be described as fairly ornate - nice light yellow color with the face of a \u201cFidel Castro\u201d-like gentleman smoking (what else) a cigar.  The words \u201cDon Douglas,\u201d  \u201cHandmade,\u201d \u201cBucanero Cigars,\u201d and \u201cNicaragua\u201d are also written on the band.  This cigar had some flakes from the wrapper stemming from the cap.  Not much attention was given to that imperfection as the flakes will be removed at the cut.Construction and Pre-Light :  This is a well-constructed cigar; no soft or hard spots were noticed.  The cigar felt nice and firm to the touch.  The cigar had no oily sheen to it.The wrapper had a cellar smell to it; the foot had a similar smell although it was faint.  The cigar was cut using a Boston Cigar Company \u201cLittle Guy\u201d V-cutter.  The draw after the cut (and before the light) was very smooth, and it tasted like caramel or honey.Flavor :  The initial flavors upon lighting the cigar was that cellar taste that was perceived from the wrapper.  To be honest, I was expecting more of the honey/caramel taste that was noted from the wrapper.  The cellar taste was not unpleasant, but not expected.  The \u201chomey\u201d taste felt stronger in the mouth than the retrohale. The ash was a nice light grey color, and it was fairly tight.  A good 1.5 in. ash was obtained prior to tapping the cigar in the ashtray.  The burn line was even throughout the smoke.  The smoke can be classified as light, and it dissipated rather quickly.Towards the end of the first third of the cigar, woody notes (oak) became more apparent.  It did seem that the cigar became more balanced the further one got into the cigar.  The cigar does feature a long finish, and it became more balanced and more mellow the further one got into the cigar.Value :  The old clich\u00e9 of \u201cyou get what you paid for\u201d applies to this particular cigar; this is not meant as a negative criticism.  For less than $5.00/stick, it is a good and affordable cigar; however, I am not sure I agree with Smoke Magazine\u2019s classification as \u201cExcellent.\u201d  Maybe \u201cGood\u201d would suffice in this case.Overall Rating :  This is what I would consider a medium-bodied, medium-flavored cigar.  For me, the biggest issue with this cigar was that original cellar smell from the wrapper and taste noted early in the cigar.  True, it became more balanced towards the second third of the cigar.  I like complex flavor profiles, but not this particular one.  I believe this cigar is not for the novice smoker, but for a seasoned one; the home smell/taste may turn off a rookie smoker.  Maybe this cigar would benefit from further aging in the humidor.  I would be willing to give this one another try after a few months (or even a year) of aging.This post was written by Ed.

The cigar is marketed as full bodied and is promoted as some of the most Cuban tasting non-Cuban cigars. The Cuban Classic is billed as a spicy cigar made from very select tobaccos.  I had the opportunity to sample their Natural Robusto and what follows is my review of this cigar.  This cigar comes from his \u201cBlack Label\u201d line and is manufactured in Nicaragua.Appearance :  The cigar is veined and rustic.  Its triple cap looks well applied and the dark brown wrapper has a nice sheen to it with no visible seams. The band is elegant but not over the top.  It is a double banded cigar with the cigar name on the main band and \u201cCuban Classic\u201d on the secondary band.

Just enough resistance on the draw and I never had to fight the cigar.  It did not require touch ups nor did it burst, swell, crack or start to unravel at any point.  I was pleased with what I considered to be exceptional construction.  The deduction was for the flaky and less than firm ash.Flavor :  The pre-draw was very aromatic.  Cedar, earth, tobacco and a slight floral note were obtained. The foot had a very pleasing and inviting cedar/woodsy aroma.The first third of the cigar offered some peppery spice with hints of unsweetened coffee, leather and cocoa. There was a pleasant peppery taste to the cigar that did not overpower the cigar and actually complimented it nicely. A touch of saltiness on the lips was present.  The smoke output was medium.  There was no texture to the smoke and the finish was relatively short.  The pepper did not linger on my palate nor did the primary flavors of leather, cedar and unsweetened coffee.As I started the second third of the cigar the smoke volume increased noticeably. By this point, the smoke was thick and rich.  The ash was a nice white/grey color but it was quite flaky often falling off in chunks. The burn was not affected though.I started to pick up some sweetness in the second third of the cigar.  Along with the primary earthiness of the cigar, there were hints of dried fruit, black cherry, coffee and very subtle hints of chocolate. As I approached the halfway point some hints of toasted caramel started to make their way into the flavour profile. The pepper remained consistent but the finish again was shorter than I had expected.Near the halfway point the primary flavors remained earthy with some leathery undertones.  The flavour became a little more complex with more hints of black cherry, toasted nuts, unsweetened coffee and some dark chocolate. The smoke output remained full but it did start to have some texture.  The smoke wasn\u2019t too oily but I did manage to pick up hints of unsweetened chocolate/cocoa in the smoke.The Cuban Classic really opened up just past the halfway point.  The finish became longer, the smoke volume intensified and carried with it more of the previously noted textures and some saltiness on the lips made the balance of flavors more enjoyable. There continued to be some pepper to the finish.  Although the cigar is marketed as being spicy I really didn\u2019t get that during my experience.  Instead I got some hints of cracked pepper that stayed consistent throughout the cigar but not really \u2018spicy\u2019 that one would expect based on the promotional material.  Needless to say this isn\u2019t a knock on the cigar but just my observation. Perhaps a little longer lingering spice would have made the experience more enjoyable.Going past the halfway mark the smoke took on some occasional sweeter tastes, with hints of black cherry dried fruit and citrus occasionally breaking through the mainly earthy/nutty notes. The finish was shorter again.Nearing the final third I started picking up some toasted nuttiness, caramel and cocoa under the primary woodsy/earthy flavors. There were some unpleasant bitter puffs but these were few.  Mainly the final third continued to dominate with cedar, black cherry, leather, unsweetened coffee and dark chocolate. The ash was still quite flakey but the burn never wavered. I hadn\u2019t seen a guitar burn so evenly in quite a while.The final third had pretty much the same blend of flavors noted above but more bitter dark chocolate notes started to enter the profile.  The cigar remained mainly woodsy and earthy but there were the occasional bursts of sweetness that made it through the profile to compliment the more prevalent bitterness at this point.  It wasn\u2019t a harsh bitterness but it was noticeable nonetheless. The cigar finished off with mainly woodsy, leathery and dark chocolate notes with a very short peppery finish.  The intensity of the peppery notes weakened during the cigar.Value :  (4.75) This robusto can be had for as low as $6.50 at many online retailers and a box of 20 averages out to $5.59 per cigar. The highest price I found for this cigar was $7.00 but again, discounts were available for buying by the box. This cigar is definitely worth the money.

Handypilot draws a comparison between Cruzado and Illusione flavor profiles. Enjoy!This stick is part of Cruzado series of smokes from Dion Giolito's Illusione brand. Similar to the Illusione, though a slightly lower price point, they incorporate blends of Criollo and Corojo. However, the Cruzado line is 2 parts Criollo and 1 part Corojo, as opposed to Illusione's 1 part Criollo and 2 parts Corojo. This stick was gifted to me from a fellow BOTL and was my first Cruzado. I was somewhat anxious to smoke the Marelas as I'm a big fan of Illusione. Here's my take...Prelight: A distinct barnyard smell, prelight draw was great with sweet tobacco flavor. Construction was good - it had a nice semi-smooth wrapper and attractive shape. However, there was a little too much vegetable gum to hold the foot together, which caused some burn issues I'll discuss momentarily.1/3: Initial tastes of sweet chocolate with a little spice, and smooth. Draw is near perfect once the foot burns down a bit. Burn is pretty even so far with one correction from a poor initial lighting. The initial lighting flamed up a bit around the wrapper from vegetable gum burning. Smooth and sweet without any spice now. Ash holding at 1/2\" to 3/4\". Very much like some of the Illusiones with flavors more subdued and lacking the distinct flavor floral/earth sweetness - More of a caramel sweet. Burn a little uneven, and needing another correction.2/3: Starting to get hints of that Illusione earthy sweetness now. Burn uneven again and requiring a touchup. Ash holding on about 1\". Aroma is very nice and sweet, smells like something sweet baking. The Illusione taste has gone away, but flavor has gotten more carmely sweeter with a near perfect burn and a perfect draw. Very smoothy and creamy - no spice.3/3: Spice has come back a bit. A little bitter after a relight, but that didn't last too long. I did notice, along with my wife, a little nutmeg aroma.Appearance :  The perfecto shape is very attractive, with a nice rich brown color and a slight colorado tone. The band was simple and elegant, though it won't win any art awards like the Opus X. The wrapper is semi-smooth with a couple small veins that blend well with its format.Construction :  This is a well constructed cigar. The perfecto shape lends witness to the skills of the torcedor... especially when it has a perfect draw. The burn issues mentioned are simply attributed to my humidity issues, and my dry-boxing impatience. The one thing I did deduct for was the vegetable gum flare-up at the foot. The liberal use of gum to create the perfecto foot caused the initial burn issues.Flavor :  This is a medium bodied cigar, with medium strength and flavor. There was a great deal of complexity with subtle flavors going in and out... This sit well with me. The Cruzado Marelas occasionally had hints of the Illusione line, which I really like, and may be attributed to the Corojo it shares. This cigar was also smooth, but had the occasional tingle on the tongue to mix it up a bit. The Marelas would've received 5 stars if the flavors were more pronounced, but that's my palate. The flavors were pretty good for a cigar that has more viso than ligero, and would make the medium-bodied cigar lover very happy.Value :  This is a good cigar for the money, and any fan of Illusione should consider Dion's Cruzado line.

I tend to acquire them in random ways like gifts from friends or box passes. Anyway, I've had one sitting in my humidor for a while now and felt it was time for a formal review of this cigar. This line is billed as an extra full-bodied, knock you on your ass cigar. I recall when they were first released in 2005; I was working in a tobacco store and nobody knew anything about the blend or what the cigar was called. Camacho had kept most information on this brand secret. It was rumored at the time to be called the \"Say Uncle,\" and sold quite well.Appearance :  This was a rustic looking cigar with a dark Colorado Maduro shade wrapper. It had an ugly poorly applied cap and had a large vein running up the side on the top half. The wrapper was smooth, but the cigar felt a bit lumpy. This Camacho had a light woodsy prelight aroma. \u00a0 Construction :  Despite being an ugly cigar, it smoked fine. This stick had a great draw and stayed lit well. However, the burn was erratic going back and forth from even to uneven.Flavor :  This cigar was pretty smooth for being as full-bodied as it is. Primary tasting notes included pepper, earth, and leather. There was also an underlying bitterness that intensified as the cigar progressed. This bitterness became vegetal at the midpoint and caused this cigar to become rather unpleasant at the end.Value :  MSRP on this cigar is around $5-$6, which I think is fair.  Deals can be found online as well, if you are so inclined.Overall Rating :  This isn't something I like to smoke all the time, but it's a good change of pace. Perfect for the golf course or yard work. I think it is definitely worth a try of you are a fan of full-bodied cigars. It doesn't excel in any area, but doesn't really have any major flaws either. Overall, an enjoyable experience, but not necessarily a memorable one.This post was written by Jason.

Most everyone knows Drew Estates from their flavored line of cigars; however, the Liga Privada No. 9 is a true masterpiece.  The brand was introduced back in 2007 in only one size (Parejo).  The cigar comes in five shapes:  Robusto (5 X 52); Torpedo (6 x 52); Double Corona (7 x 52); a very limited release Perfecto known as the Flying Pig (4.13 x 60); and today\u2019s featured cigar the Toro.  All cigars come in an oscuro wrapper.Appearance :  The cigar\u2019s color is a very dark chocolate.  It has a very nice oily sheen, and the cigar feels oily in the hands.  There are some visible veins but nothing to be concerned about.The band looks very simple; it has \u201cLiga Privada No. 9\u201d written in a black cursive font.  The background is offwhite, and on the top of the band, the phrase \u201cHecho Exclusivamente Para El Jefe\u201d (Made Exclusively for the Boss) and \u201cParejo Oscuro.\u201d The bottom of the band features the phrase \u201cLa Gran Fabrica Drew Estates S.A.\u201d (The Great Drew Estates Factory). The trademarked lion seal is seen on the side of the band.Construction :  The cigar looks like it just has two caps at the head.   The cigar felt very firm to the touch. Halfway through the cigar, the cigar shows a bit of a soft touch, but it would not be considered a soft spot.The ash was white and nicely packed.  Throughout the smoke, the burn was very even.  The cigar itself was not too smokey, and it rose and dissipated quickly.  About an inch of ash was obtained before tapping it off in the ashtray.The band was loose during the pre-light, so it was very easy to remove.Flavor :  The wrapper had a subtle sweet smell with a hint of grass.  I would have expected more pronounced scents coming off an oscuro wrapper.  The foot also had a subtle sweet smell to it.  The scent of the wrapper was definitely more noticeable than the foot of the cigar.Because of the large ring gauge, a Palio guillotine cutter was used to cut the cigar.  The pre-light draw had a very nice chocolate/coffee taste.  The cigar also featured a very easy draw even for a 52 ring gauge and a fairly packed cigar.   The taste to the tongue was salty and slightly spicy.After lighting the cigar, and letting it come to a nice temperature, a whole slew of flavors just were noticeable.  Leather, cacao, and a variety of spices coated the mouth.  A smoke had a very nice and creamy feel to it.After lighting the cigar, the first draw was spicy and peppery.  This was the feeling through the first half although leathery notes were picked up towards the middle of the cigar.  About an inch into the cigar, a touch of a sweet taste similar to a sweet dinner roll became apparent.The second half of the cigar featured roasted nuts and outstanding tobacco notes.  I was expecting to get a nice nicotine kick out of this cigar, but I never did.  The flavors were very enjoyable.Towards the end of the smoke, a slight bitterness started to overcome all of the great flavors, but it was still a great smoking experience.Value :  The $9.00/stick cost is absolutely well worth the investment.  This cigar gives you everything you want out of this price range:  great looks, good construction, and unbelievable flavors.Overall Rating :  This cigar can be summarized in one word:  outstanding!

In 2008, the Frank was released. Last year, it was time for the Drac and the Boris to burn their way into the cigar lovers\u2019 hearts. Since all of these Halloween blends are limited editions and very hard to find, I managed to get my hands on a Boris only, missing the Drac. Only 1000 boxes of 10 Boris each were produced.For this review, I smoked an aged Boris \u2013 and I have to say, it was worth the wait: aging conferred a unique flavor to the cigar, ramping up the Boris from \u201cgood\u201d, as other have rated it, to a rather great level \u2013 in my books. Let\u2019s get started and see in detail how this Halloween monster fares.Appearance :  The dark brown wrapper of the Boris has a rustic feel to it that looks great. However, the surface of this 7 X 49 cigar is rather bumpy and has some prominent veins (not downright \u201cugly\u201d, but with a stronger visual presence than in other cigars). The band of the cigar has a simple design, consisting of the brand\u2019s name, Tatuaje, inscribed in black on a white background.Construction :  The construction department is in much better standing: the Boris is well rolled, has no soft spots and feels good in the hand. The draw is slightly loose, while the burn of the cigar is great \u2013 even though I had minor issues and had to slightly correct it, the ash left behind had a fantastic light color to it and at some point, measured an amazing 3.5\u201d.Flavor :  At first, I was unsure what to expect from this cigar, seeing as how the previous Halloween release, the Frank, wasn\u2019t quite up my alley. However, once I passed the Boris by my nose, a familiar Tatuaje spice, combined with a note of sweet tobacco, hit my senses and highly pleased me. The pre-light draw has smitten me with a wonderful peppermint scent. Once lit, the aroma I have previously described still lingered for a while, but the front scene was taken by spice and pepper, accompanied by a surfacing cedar note. The first third prolongs its footprint into the second part of the cigar, but this time, a subtle nutty scent mingles with the rather strong pepper and the pure tobacco flavor. As I\u2019m smoking through the final third, a full blown spice aroma assaulted my senses, in the traditional Tatuaje style. This powerful finish is slightly toned down by flavors of almond and a touch of leather.Value :  At $12.5, the Tatuaje Boris is on the upper end of the price echelon, but I\u2019d say it is worth the money \u2013 it has great potential to enchant you and become one of your favorites.Overall Rating :  (4.25) The Boris is without any doubt, a high quality cigar with a great flavor profile, but it does not fully match my personal preferences.

Also known as Tatuaje Miami, Tatuaje Classics, Tatuaje Cabinet series, and even more formally (and very rarely) as Tatuaje La Seleccion de Cazador.  The Cojonu extension is a series of very strong cigars that are released in a new shape every three years.  It started with the Cojonu 2003 which was a long toro, and that was followed by the Cojonu 2006; a belicoso.  So 2009 predictably brought us the next installment which happens to be a very long torpedo with a very short and rounded taper at the head.  As I have always understood it, each of these cigars is the same blend with the same binder and wrapper,  the difference with each edition being the vitola.  So it is good to note that the year on these cigars does not refer to what most cigar smokers normally associate a year with.  It doesn\u2019t have to do with the crop, or the year it was made.  It is simply the name of the vitola.  Much like the Lonsdale in the classic Brown label line is called a Havana Cazadore, this torpedo is called 2009.  All three vitolas are regular production cigars and all three are still made and available today.As I mentioned the Cojonu blend is much stronger in body and power than the already quite robust standard Brown Label blends.  The story goes that the name of the line, Cojonu, is a play on a slang Spanish term meaning \u201cballsy\u201d.  An obvious reference to the strength of the blend.  The Cojonu wrapper is an aged ligero leaf so it had plenty of time in the sun while it was growing and the result is a very dark and very rustic looking wrapper.  The flash in my photo doesn\u2019t do it justice as it sort of bleeds out the color making it appear a much lighter shade of brown than it appears in living color.  It is well filled, and a pre-light  test draw revealed a good but slightly lighter than expected draw.It is commonly held that if you take what is essentially the same cigar and change the size, it changes the flavors and experience.  I subscribe to this with the following assumption.  When you change the size you are not merely changing the length but also the thickness, or ring gauge.  I think that goes to explain why, in my opinion,  there is virtually no difference at all between the Cojonu 2003 and the 2006.  Both cigars are a 52 ring but the 2003 has about an inch on the \u201906 in length.  In that case there were no discernible differences in the two vitolas in my opinion.  To me, they tasted and smoked identically.  The 2009 stepped down a bit on the ring gauge to a 48 ring.  This time I noticed a difference.  A large one actually.When a cigar gets smaller the blend has to change in some ways.  While the percentages of the different filler types used in the blend may remain consistent, the simple fact is you cannot cram the same amount of tobacco, in the same configuration into a thinner cigar.  So while you are smoking, the percentage of ligero to seco that is burning may be the same, in the thinner cigar there is simply less total ligero and less total seco burning at the same time than there is in the thicker cigar.  So it just goes to figure that there would be a difference in how the cigar tastes and behaves in general.So how does all this come into play with the Cojonu 2009.  Well the first thing I noticed was that the 2009 is noticeably milder that it\u2019s brothers.  That is not in any way to suggest it is a mild cigar.  It is still a full bodied smoke, but it doesn\u2019t have the same \u201ckick you in the head\u201d effect that the other two seem to have.  One thing I have always been impressed with when smoking the Cojonu cigars is how smooth they are despite their ample power.  This is still true with the 2009, and the toned down power has another favorable side effect.  I believe it allows some more of the subtitles of the blend to come through.  The flavors are very similar to the previous two versions, they just come to play at different volumes now.  The peppery start is there, just less overwhelming.  The core of earth, hardwoods, and cocoa are there as well and seem to have a creamy texture to them.  The most notable change however is the cherry notes.  In the \u201903 and \u201906 I\u2019d get fleeting hard to pin down flashes of cherry every once and a while as if it could only muster the strength to push past the other more robust flavors occasionally and only for a brief moment.  With the 2009, the cherry notes are less subtle and easier to detect, balancing out the less sweet core flavors very nicely.  I have smoked a couple of these cigars now and I can safely say the 2009 is my favorite Cojonu.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Fuego is one of a number of relatively new, \"boutique\" cigar brands that are taking the cigar world by storm. Founded just a few years ago in 2006 by Jesus Fuego (whose familial involvement in the cigar industry extends all the way back to 1876 in Cuba), the J. Fuego brand has quickly expanded to include five different lines, as well as the spin-off 777 brand. Sangre de Toro (which translates to \"Bull's Blood\") is the newest line, released in Spring 2011, and the Original is the newest vitola, released at ICPCR 2011. Jesus Fuego has described the tobacco used in the Sangre de Toro line as \"heavy and well-aged stuff,\" and the Original vitola showcases all the richness that this tobacco can deliver. The Originals come five to a soft pack, and the very attractive design on the pack mimics the design on the Sangre de Toro bands; however, the Originals themselves are unbanded.Appearance :  The Sangre de Toro line was named for the reddish hue of its wrapper, which someone in the marketing department apparently thought was similar to blood. While the wrapper color is striking, it's the only part of this cigar that has any visual appeal.

However, even with the small sips, the smoke was plentiful. The cigar burned generally straight and never required a touch-up, but the ash was flaky.Flavor :  One word sums up the flavors: RICH. The word \"rich\" shows up seven times in my tasting notes, and it should probably be in there even more. Pre-light, the cigar smelled very strongly of earth and tobacco, and the cold draw was pure tobacco. After lighting, the first puffs filled my mouth with plentiful smoke that tasted of extremely rich tobacco and earth with a hint of white pepper on the retrohale. As the cigar developed, rich leather and wood joined the profile as well, always with a touch of pepper. The smoke remained thick and plentiful throughout. About halfway in, an intriguing burnt marshmallow taste flitted in and out of the profile, complimenting the rich earth and wood.

They are the only cigars that are not Nicaraguan puros in his portfolio. Cruzado means \"bearer of the cross\" and the bands are gilded in gold, silver, and black with the Cruzado name aside the Crest of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Much like the Illusione MJ12's, the Domenicos Extra is wrapped in gold foil instead of silver.It seems that availability of the Cruzado line is fairly more limited than his other popular lines (Epernay & Illusione). And among the Cruzados, the Domenicos Extra is the rarest. Several of the other vitolas have been discontinued over time only leaving a few sizes left. It's no secret that I am a huge fan of the Illusione & Epernay lines, and the former seems to be the overall favorite cigar amongst my circle of friends. The Domenicos Extras I smoked for this review are the first I have had of the Cruzado line. So here goes,...Appearance :  The Domenicos Extra is a dark brown, perfectly cylindrical cigar with several large, long veins and visible seams. The tiny veins are even visible and highlighted by a lighter tan coloration. There is a Cuban triple cap and the tiniest of pig tails wrapped atop of the cap.Construction :  Just looking at it, everything seems to be in order with this cigar. The Cruzado is tightly packed with not much give when squeezed along its sides. The dry draw is a little tighter than I like but I can still move air through it fairly easily.The burn through the first third was a little wavy but self-corrected sufficiently. The light grey ash holds on for an entire third and only fell off cause I drop the cigar on the ground.From the second third in, the burn was hampered by thick veins and would not burn properly around the seams. There were 2-3 touch ups that were minor and afterwards the cigar would burn pretty well. All the way through the cigar put ample amounts of good creamy smoke.Flavor :  (3.75) Dry draw reveals a little potpourri/floral thing going on with some hints of sweet tobacco.On the first couple of puffs, the cigar is quite smooth, with little pepper, and nice flavors of cedar and leather. The strength of the smoke is definitely light and a little shy of medium strength. To me, this is a lighter Illusione MJ12 with a touch of cedar thrown into the mix.Coming near the second third, the leather flavors I associate with Nica tobacco have disappeared and are replaced with nuttiness, cedar, and cinnamon spice. The body continues to be very mild and just short of medium still. Interesting enough, the profile is now more akin to the Epernay line.In a unique turn, the last third of the cigar makes almost a complete 180 and heads for strength town. The body is amped up quite a bit and is a solid medium+. The mild cinnamon spice has been replaced with peppery spice that is mostly felt in the retrohale. I feel a lot of tannins in this portion of the cigar which leads me to believe that this cigar could age for a year or two and not lose much. The nuttiness is now met with woodsy flavors with a strong backing of cedar. This is a nice, long, enjoyable smoke that lasts almost 2 hours.Value :  For the size and balance of this cigar it delivers a pretty solid value. $10 is really pushing it and I wouldn't pay anything over that for this particular stick. There is just too much out there to compete with if the price tag was a little higher.Overall Rating :  (3.75) This is a good cigar.

So when Lufthansa started offering return flights to Munich, Germany for 99 Turkish Lira, I was all over it. God bless global economic recession!In Germany I discovered this brand of cigars I had never before heard of. I bought a sampler pack of every Robusto in the Belmore range. And there was one very clear winner: the Cameroon Selection Robusto. Strong yet sweet, spicy yet not so overpowering as to mask a multitude of other flavours, this cigar is really something. If you are familiar with the Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story, which similarly has a Cameroon wrapper and is very very good, then just imagine what a fatter, easier drawing and longer lasting stick will do for you.Now living in Tokyo Japan, I can buy Cubans off the Internet at great prices. But, this cheap smoke is as good as any mainstream Cuban. Yes, really!  I just can\u2019t find anyone out there who stocks the Belmore range and is willing to ship them internationally. Language becomes a problem too, for any European based online retailer. If you\u2019re lucky enough to live in the U.S.A., you can get them at Camino Viejo Tabacos. If anyone out there knows how to get these shipped internationally, please share the knowledge.Pictured above is the Torpedo at 50 x 6. The Robusto is shorter at 50 x 5.

That being said, on to the good stuff.The topic of this review is the Tatuaje - Private Reserve Black Tubo.  You may notice that as the background for the photos I used my chopper (another of those things I haven't had much time for).  I did this as a tribute to Pete Johnson, owner of Tatuaje, because the first time we met I had been out on it and Pete and I spent some time talking about our shared enjoyment of riding.  Pete said the inspiration for the Black Tubo came from a trip he took to, \"an island famous for its cigars\", which one can only assume is Cuba.  While there he was given an un-banded, very rustic looking cigar by a man who had it in his shirt pocket.  He later learned that among many of the local cigar lovers is a tradition of rolling their own blends for themselves to suit their personal taste, hence Private Reserve in the name of this cigar.  Pete never forgot how much he enjoyed that cigar and the Black Tubo is his tribute to it.Released in 2009 the Black Tubo in my opinion is a Pyramid, even though it doesn't flare outward at the foot.  Some have called it a Torpedo but by definition a Torpedo tapers at the head and foot which this does not.  Made in Nicaragua and distributed only in a 6-1/8\" x 52 vitolla in boxes of 10 each, it has a Belicoso style head and unfinished foot, and is a Nicaraguan puro with a Criollo '98 capa.  The capa, which I put between colorado and colorado rosado in color, was rugged in appearance with plenty of teeth and veins present, although surprisingly soft to the touch.  It passed the squeeze test with flying colors being very firm but not hard and had no flaws or soft spots.  The pre-light aroma was very sweet with strong woody and earth notes.  I thought I detected a cedar influence; however, it had been in one of my humidours for nearly a year so that has to be taken into consideration.  I have to say though that I spent many minutes just enjoying and trying to define the complexity of the aroma.Finally I made a straight cut with scissors which was perfectly clean and never frayed or produced any debris all the way through to the end of the smoke; evidence of quality rolling and tobacco.  The pre-light taste was woody, like the aroma, and the draw was almost effortless.  It lit easily and evenly, even with the unfinished foot and produced plenty of smooth, light grey smoke.  The first puff was filled with pepper and had perhaps a slight woody finish.  Throughout the first 1/2\", pepper was the dominant taste but then began to mellow and the slightest tingle started around the tip of the tongue.  Even in the first 1/3 this cigar was showing strongly bi-phasic qualities, coming right off the blocks with good strength which was followed by an extremely relaxed feeling even though I hadn't eaten in some time.  Retro-exhalation was a bit hot but that's expected from a strong cigar and the spice could be pleasantly felt throughout the sinuses.  The ash didn't drop off until almost a solid 2\" in and was firm and crisp feeling, following which a slight touch-up was required.  Around mid-way mellow, woody notes were the dominant and consistent taste but as it progressed into the final 1/3, pepper and spice began to re-emerge but didn't overwhelm. A slight tingle as well as what was perhaps a \"roasty\" taste also spread along the middle of the tongue and a second slight touch-up was needed.  It finished nicely and the taste lingered a little while but not at all in an unpleasant way.I give the Tatuaje - Private Reserve Black Tubo very high over-all marks.  It was a very enjoyable cigar that you'll want to sit back and enjoy.  In fact, it was one of those cigars that you debate with yourself about when to let the nub go, probably right about the time that it burns your fingers because there isn't enough left to hold on to.  The bad thing about the Black Tubo is they are no longer in production, so if you see some at your tobacconist, grab them.As always, I wish you Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

On Saturday, between sleeping in and making a trek to the animal circus known as the mall, a perfect window popped open and of course, I jumped at the opportunity to fire one up.  Pulling together my arsenal and securing a post on the front porch I was ready to settle in with a DVD of The Sopranos and a Diamond Crown Maximus No. 5 Robusto.Holding this cigar, the first thing that rings out is how good it feels.  Perhaps it is because the last couple of smokes have been figurado shaped or smaller vitolas or perhaps it is simply a solid stick; either way, the Maximus has an excellent balance and heft to it.  Gaudy, colorful and wide, the band on this cigar looks like a Turkish Bazaar specializing in the sale of Las Vegas memorabilia.  Shielding my eyes from the light glinting off of it, I proceed to inspect the wrapper.  Unlike the band, the wrapper is dark.  Not maduro but similar to a Full City coffee.  Regretfully, the first thing I notice is that some chipping has occurred at the foot.  As this cigar is one of the first I obtained, this is likely due to mishandling on my part as I was an avid player of humidor Tetris prior to establishing a better system.  Only affecting the outermost layers of the wrapper at the foot no less, it does not appear to be of great concern. Two more significant flaws pull my attention away from this.  Within the wrapper there are a couple of prominent veins, which may be enough to throw the burn off course.  The other issue of note is that the wrapper is actually wrinkled in one area.  It appears as though when the cigar was being wrapped the leaf bunched slightly and caused some ribbing parallel to the seam.  Overall, these imperfections appear to be surface flaws because there are no soft spots during the pinch test and the cut it clean. Initially, the draw is perfect.  Prelight notes are of cocoa, earth, and something slightly sweet.  Lighting the cigar, the initial puffs allow flavors of earth and pepper to assert themselves.  Faint tingling on the back of the throat lingers after expelling the thick white smoke.  A sharp burn starts this cigar nicely and does not falter through the chipped foot.  Shortly after, the pepper and tingling sensation disappears completely and a slightly sweet flavor crops up again to accompany the earth and cocoa.  Exhaling through the nose enhances the earthiness and downplays the sweet cocoa, only to have it come rushing back again after the next puff.  After one such series, I realized that the cocoa combined with the sweetness and thicker smoke, creates a profile similar to milk chocolate. Through the one third mark the Diamond Crown Maximus has maintained a steady, albeit wavy, burn.  At this point, however, the cigar begins to canoe.  With one side burning significantly faster than the others, rotating and wetting do nothing to resolve the problem.  So, the ash comes off and a touchup is done to correct.  A slight bitterness presents itself after the touchup but promptly fades.  This is also, the only time the cigar required any touchup or that the burn goes significantly off course. Halfway through, the pepper replaces the sweet and the earth tones take over.  There is also a taste akin to toasted almonds.  Periodically the bitterness, hinted at during the touchup, came back again.  Each time it did, however, it was stronger and drowned out more of the other flavors.  As the cigar approached the last inch and a half, the bitterness became too much and I set it down to go out on its own. Of all the cigars reviewed thus far, this is the first that I have actually tried on another occasion prior to choosing it for a review.  Having enjoyed the other one greatly, I was actually quite surprised that this one did not follow suit.  The prior smoke was chocked full of coffee and chocolate, which continually seesawed back and forth through the majority of the cigar.  I was disappointed in this specific stick\u2019s performance and inconsistency compared to the other one.  The scores below are isolated to this specific stick but had this experience matched the prior one, the scores would have been significantly higher.  In light of this I would recommend trying one of these to see for yourself.  I certainly plan to.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

Their much respected production is centered in the famed Santiago de los Caballeros. This area is endowed with an ideal climate and fertile soils perfectly suited to prime tobacco production.Currently under the direction of Jose Blanco, their more than 100 years of blending expertise continues to net the highest of accolades. Year after year they consistently produce wonderfully complex cigars of the highest quality. The Series 1994 Cameroon is no exception.After 14 years of aging in the cedar lined vaults of La Aurora this prime Cameroon wrapper was released for production, having extremely limited production, only 18,000 cigars total, less than 2,000 boxes of 10 were produced. At the time of publication I am currently unable to find any of these available anywhere (they are available from one of our main sponsors, CigarsDirect.com - Inspector - not anymore). I was fortunate enough some time ago to acquire 1 box of 10, currently only 7 are left in my humidor.Appearance :  This cigar is not what I would call flashy.

Closing the first third is a delicate cocoa flavor on the first palate that has a supporting, yet subtle spice. Second palate is prevalent with raisin and spice flavors and a currant note.

Actually this cigar is the \u201cFirst Limited Edition 2007\u2033 which leads me to believe we may see other incarnations of this line sometime in the future.  My guess is it will be a different blend but will carry the same name, but this is just speculation on my part.  This edition only saw 850 boxes of each size made.  What is known about the blend is that it uses Criollo 99 and Corojo 99 tobacco grown in Nicaragua.  The best leaves were selected for this blend and were aged for 3 years under watchful eyes and in the best conditions.It is available in just three vitolas:Today I am smoking the Guerreros which is a standard robusto size.  It is well constructed, firm with a nicely applied triple cap.  The wrapper is a reddish, tan color with a few fine viens running across it and it has an oily sheen.  Looking at the bunch in the foot and at the head after clipping, you can see this cigar is jam packed full of tobacco.  The burn was razor sharp and it produced a perfectly formed, firm, white ash.  I started off talking about the construction because it is the best part of the cigar.  I was a bit disappointed by the flavor of this smoke.  It was pleasant enough but I was expecting more from a limited edition cigar.  As is typical with most of Pepin\u2019s cigars there is plenty of black pepper especially at the start, but it remains present throughout the smoke.  There is also a woodiness to it with a slightly bitter finish that I could have done without.  The cigar never developed, never changed.  The flavors remained consistent throughout.  This cigar actually reminded me a lot of Pepin\u2019s Vegas Cubanas.  It is medium bodied, and not quite as strong as a lot of his other lines.  The El Centurion isn\u2019t a bad cigar, but I feel it underperforms for a limited edition cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I have had numerous cigars offer more aroma from the nose than this stick exhibited from the foot. Bad start.The initial light was rather easy. A few quick puffs and we were off. The initial inch or so of the smoke was fairly boring. There were hints of spice, but this was drowned by an unimpressive woodsy, earthy taste.   Somewhere in the initial third, I started to pick up more of the spice. There were also faint instances of a sweet taste, but far too isolated to be of real note.The last half of the cigar saved the classification of \u201cdecent\u201d smoke. The spice picked up, turning into a peppery taste. The inhale would leave a tingle of spice on the tip of my tongue, with a nice coffee taste to follow.

First of all I had not found another cigar that has the complexity of the Padron \u00a01926. \u00a0So when I started reading the blogs about the Padron family reserve 45 maduro, it piqued my interest. \u00a0I went to my favorite cigar shop to see if I could find them. \u00a0As it turned out, they had one box tucked away in the corner of the humidor. \u00a0The price was a little off putting. \u00a0I usually don\u2019t spend that much on a single cigar. \u00a0But having such a great experience with the 1926, I couldn\u2019t resist. \u00a0I bought two and safely tucked them away for a special occasion. \u00a0I was telling a friend, a member of my \u00a0Cigar Therapy Group, of my find. \u00a0He got very excited and wanted to share the experience together. \u00a0As I was driving to meet my wife after work, he started texting me. \u00a0How many can we get? \u00a0Jim wants in \u2026..Mike won\u2019t spend the money\u2026Mike wants in! \u00a0I politely excused myself early from my wife\u2019s function and rushed home to meet the guys. \u00a0Dave generously brought a case of Guinness. \u00a0It turned out to be a beautiful night to sit outside around a fire. \u00a0I had already put my firepit and patio furniture in the basement. \u00a0But this was an emergency meeting of the Cigar Therapy Group Dave and Mike insisted on pulling out my neatly stowed furniture. \u00a0We sat around the fire anxiously awaiting Jim\u2019s arrival. we could not wait to light up the highly anticipated Padron 45. \u00a0Jim arrived with his copy of the latest edition of cigar aficionado and his travel humidor. \u00a0The moment had arrived. \u00a0Jim was reading aloud about the Padron 45 maduro as I brought out the box with the coveted cigars that the cigar shop have given me when I bought the last three. \u00a0The box is beautiful. \u00a0On the inside lid it bears the image and story of \u201cthe little hammer\u201d. \u00a0We passed the box around the circle as part of the ritual each of us smelling the box as we took a cigar. \u00a0Initially we noticed the powerful spice that almost overwhelmed the palette. \u00a0It didnt take long to notice the dark chocolate and coca undertones. \u00a0As we smoked the flavors become more and more balanced. \u00a0All of us smoked, until we could not hold the stub anymore. \u00a0We all agreed that this is another great cigar from the Padrons!! \u00a0Definately to be shared amoung friends. Highly recommended by the Cigar Therapy Group. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0", "i still prefer the 1926 or the 1964.

Wow strong cigar, lots a smoke, I couldn\u2019t do without a cold mocha frap. Flavorful\u2026. not the toasty taste of a monte 2, which though inconsistant, I prefer\u2026.", "*This was one of the best non-Cuban cigars I\u2019ve enjoyed in decades. It is one powerful muthah!

Flavorful, smooth, and will knock the socks off you!!!", "Arthur, it sounds like you have a great group of mates.  Thanks for sharing and fare well.", "This cigar is really something. it is to me like smoking a God of Fire except with more flavor and strength. Maybe not as smooth but it is a cigar to you must try. To me it is extremely creamy with mocha taste.", "At $28, I would honestly have to say this cigar is overrated.  The 1926 and other Padrons, I found to be better cigars.  To me the cigar is too loosely rolled and had too much O2 in the draw.  While burning the ash (because of the loose roll) is flaky and loose.  The flavor is almost too smooth for me.  While it is a good one, not worth the almost $30 price tag.", "First let me say I can still be classified as a \u201cnewbie\u201d when it comes to cigars\u2026 this is about my 15th smoke. This is also my first Padron. The initial light was fairly easy and even. On the first 1/4 it had a dry and rather spicy taste. Although not at all bitter. It quickly progressed into a very smooth taste with a hint of cocoa which remained throughout the experience. A bit of cedar was also noted. The draw was exceptional (even after cutting it with my cheap single blade cutter) I really started feeling a \u201ckick\u201d towards the final 1/4 and had to end bit early. The stick had exceptional construction although it did seem to burn rather fast however that may only be because of my lack of a seasoned smoking technique. Overall I would recommend this cigar to anyone looking for a premium smoke. It also pairs well with a medium blend coffee if you\u2019d like to experiment a bit!\u00a0"], "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/padron/padron-family-reserve-no-45", "full review": "Hello fellow lovers of the leaf, I recently returned from overseas, just in time to attend a very special event. I had the distinct pleasure and privilege of meeting Jorge Padron, President of Padron Cigars and son of founder, Jose Padron. I missed the opportunity to meet him last year when he came through Baltimore because I was deployed again so I made sure my schedule didn\u2019t conflict this time, though it was a close one. I had been very much looking forward to this event, not only because it was an opportunity to meet Mr. Padron, but also because he was bringing with him the new Padron Family Reserve No. 45. Ever since reading the posting about them by Jorge Armenteros in the Tobacconist University Forum, I have been anticipating the opportunity to enjoy what was certain to be a fine cigar.Jorge Padron was an extremely personable man. He had a very genuine smile on his face the whole time and shared several stories with me. Two of my favorites were the stories of when, after graduating college, he told his father that they should replace the plain brown bands on their cigars with something more flashy to increase sales, following which his father put him in his place in no uncertain terms; and of how his cousin, who he says the family just refers to as the \u201ccrazy cousin\u201d, defused a bomb someone had placed in their Miami facility about thirty years ago.So on to the good stuff. The 45 is a Nicaraguan puro made from tobaccos aged at least ten years! Now that\u2019s good anejamiento. It is being offered as a box-pressed, parejo (6 x 52 \u2013 Toro vitolla) in both natural and maduro, which frankly can\u2019t be visibly differentiated. The appearance was beautiful. The wrapper was dark and consistent with no visible flaws. Its construction was just right; firm yet slightly flexible, and recovered immediately from the squeeze test, all characteristics of a high quality, well-made cigar. It also had a very interesting feel, not silky but perhaps best described as sleek with a fascinating texture that close examination revealed to cover the whole wrapper. I enjoyed the pre-light aroma very much, which can only be described as subtle and understated with a hint of sweetness.I made a punch-cut and tested the draw, which was perfect. It offered just the right amount of resistance without effort and the draw-volume was excellent. It lit easily and evenly, signaling that the best was yet to come. From the very first puff the 45 was full-bodied, robust, balanced, and strong, but in no way overpowering. It produced copious amounts of thick, blue-grey smoke, characteristic of quality tobacco, that you didn\u2019t want to blow out as much as let it just roll out of your mouth. It had a creamy overall mouth-feel while producing a spicy tingle all around the tongue. It burned evenly without any problems or even a re-light and produced an attractive, firm and dense, light-grey ash with dark undertones. As it continued to smoke, the flavor and strength mellowed but lost none of the complexity or balance all the way to the end, and I smoked it down to the nub. Jorge told me he smoked about one thousand cigars while trying to reach the right balance and flavor for the 45. It shows because in my opinion, this cigar has umami.My overall opinion of the Padron Family Reserve No. 45 is that it is an outstanding cigar. I recommend you enjoy it slowly and on a full stomach because the strength in the beginning was undeniable. It is complex and balanced throughout and deserves your attention while being smoked. In my area, after taxes they came out to $27.75 each. I really wanted to buy a whole box and let them continue to age in my humidor but I just couldn\u2019t get away with it right now so I grabbed a handful and will be sorry to see the last one go. Bravo-Zulo to the Padron family for the 45.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/padron-45.jpg?iv=16"}, "perdomo 10th anniverary criollo": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Churchill Size : 7 x 54 Wrapper : Cuban-seed Criollo Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$7 eachMore info about purchasing Perdomo 10th Anniversary Criollo...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "perdomo", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["What is it with Perdomo and their complete lack of consistency in they way they band their cigars?

Honduran-made, this is the first cigar to boast using binder from the Nicaraguan island of Ometepe.La Escepcion Excepcionales qualifies as one of those that you are looking through your local B&M and the band or name catches your eye, and you don\u2019t recognize it right away (or at all in my case). I caught this one in a middle display, partially paired between a couple of boxes of La Traviatas, which I also purchased at that time. Always up for trying something unfamiliar to me, I picked up a couple to see what I could discern.I did come upon two minor issues with the physical appearance of the cigar: one small cuff in the wrapper and a soft spot about the width of my pinkie finger around the middle of the cigar. None of these issues affected the draw or burn of the cigar.  Aromas of wood and a hint of chocolate were detected from the cigar pre-burn, which were confirmed in the flavors upon burning.I used a cutter and butane lighter for starting the cigar and was met with an even, easy draw right from the onset. Wood hints and a bit of spice were the predominant flavors at the beginning. While the spice faded away after an initial five to ten minutes, I did discover slight hints of chocolate closer to the halfway point in the cigar's two and a half hour burn time. While I enjoyed the flavors of the cigar and the draw, I felt a bit like the overall flavors stayed monotone; it lacked the complexity of flavor that we can be accustomed to from other brands.While I would describe the flavors as medium bodied, the taste didn\u2019t stay with me for more than a couple of hours. The thick, grayish-white smoke was a nice touch as well. The only drawbacks I found with this cigar was that the burn did need a couple of minor corrections throughout the duration. The ash was also quite flaky and ended up with a lap or couch cushion full. While I am certainly a magnet to cigar ash, this particular cigar made it only that much worse.I have to say that I enjoyed this cigar but it didn\u2019t necessarily blow me away. The complement of flavors were nice but it didn\u2019t have the complexity to really make this cigar a home-run hitter. The drawbacks were minor with this cigar and the price point I felt was fair. I\u2019m curious to know if anyone out there has aged these for any length of time (three months plus) and if that would make this cigar shine a bit more. While I wouldn\u2019t turn this cigar down if offered, I can\u2019t say for certain if I would purchase La Escepcion again.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

The various sizes consistently produce high ratings from cigar reviewers everywhere. And as is often the case when someone or something achieves such a high level of success, it has fostered a kind of love-hate relationship with avid cigar smokers. Like the New York Yankees are the baseball team so many love to hate, the Opus is a cigar that, in addition to high praise, also elicits some vehement dislike from some in the cigar world who believe the cigar is over hyped and over priced. I have never heard anyone say it was a bad cigar though. Like or dislike the line for whatever reasons, everyone seems to agree if you set aside the hype, the price, and all the other outside \u201cstuff\u201d and take the cigars just by themselves, the Opus X line of cigars are pretty good smokes.A big part of what makes the Opus X so special is its wrapper. Before the Fuentes managed to grow the wrapper that is used for the Opus X, no one had ever successfully grown wrapper tobacco in the Dominican Republic. The Fuentes were the first to do it. The wrapper is grown in very limited quatities on their Chateau de la Fuente farm in the Dominican. Here is the story on how the OpusX came to be as it is explained on the Cigar Family website:The secret of the Fuente Fuente Opus X is the cigar\u2019s exquisite, silken Rosado wrapper leaves that are grown of the Fuente family\u2019s renown organic tobacco plantation, Chateau de la Fuente, which is located in a remote, tropical river valley in the Dominican Republic.When the Fuentes planted their first crop of this outstanding wrapper leaf in the early 1990\u2032s, the rest of the cigar industry scoffed because everyone else who had tried to grow wrapper in the Dominican had failed. However, the Fuentes achieved the impossible and the Fuente Fuente Opus X was born.The cigar\u2019s name is derived from \u201cProject X\u201d which is what the Fuentes originally named their experimental tobacco crop. \u201cFuente Fuente\u201d refers to the partnership of Carlos Fuente, father and son, and the word \u201cOpus\u201d was chosen to describe the cigar\u2019s unique wrapper. \u201cThe tobacco was oily and rich, leading me to the word opulent, but that was too long,\u201d Carlos Fuente, Jr., said. \u201cAnd while studying the dictionary, I came across the word \u2018opus\u2019 \u2013 meaning creative work, masterpiece, a work of a lifetime. It was perfect.\u201dThe limited nature of these cigars along with the high praise and abundance of press and hype that surrounds them, makes these cigars highly sought after and hard to find. The Opus X comes in 12 basic sizes, but there are and abundance of special sizes and limited releases as well. Sticking to the standard sizes here, the Opus X is available in the following vitolas\u2026Belicoso xXx \u2013 4.625 x 49 Perfecxion No. 5 \u2013 4.875 x 40 Perfecxion No.4 Series X \u2013 5.1875 x 43 Robusto \u2013 5.250 x 50 Fuente Fuente \u2013 5.625 x 46 Super Belicoso \u2013 5.625 x 54 Perfecxion X \u2013 6.250 x 48 Petite Lancero \u2013 6.250 x 39 Perfecxion No.2 \u2013 6.375 x 52 Reserva D\u2019Chateau \u2013 7.000 x 48 Double Corona \u2013 7.625 x 49 \u201cA\u201d \u2013 9.250 x 47Although I have never personally put the Opus X among my absolute favorite cigars, they are excellent smokes and are a special treat.The Opus xXx is also nicknamed the \u201cPower Ranger\u201d due to its reputation as one of the more robust and powerful vitolas in the line.  It is a Short Belicoso and like all Opus X cigars, the presentation of this stogie is beautiful.  Dressed with the very ornate Opus X band, it also sports a handsome red ribbon around its foot.  The Rosado wrapper is smooth and oily with almost no veins to speak of.  The xXx starts off with a lot of spice an pepper which is followed up with a slight sweetness once you work your way a bout an inch in.  It is a robust and dynamic smoke delivering a mix of leather, earth, nuts, and coffee is a seemingly random pattern.  It also packs a sneaky punch.  It builds up slowly at first, giving the impression that it is a medium bodied smoke of average strength and as you make your way through the smoke you begin to realize that it is more full bodied than you first thought and the power of it sneaks up on you.  After I was about half way through the cigar, I turned my head suddenly and the effect was surprising.  I didn\u2019t realize until then that I had a good little nicotine buzz going.The construction is impeccable, and the burn and draw are perfect.  The ash holds tight and won\u2019t fall of unless you tap it.  It burns slow and cool too.  Despite its short length it still takes a good hour to smoke it.  I have had the pleasure of trying the Opus X in most of the sizes listed above and the xXx has been my favorite of them all with the Petite Lancero coming in a close second.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

According to the April 13, 2010 issue of Cigar Insider the wrapper leaves for these cigars are \u201cgrown in Yamas\u00e1, an area of the Dominican Republic north of the capital city of Santo Domingo and far from Santiago and its surrounding tobacco fields.\u201d This cigar by far bears the darkest wrapper in the Davidoff Collection (minus the maduro line).  Also, worth noting is that at that time the Puro D'Oro was the first new Davidoff release in more than 10 years (since then, the brand released many more new blends).These cigars are available in four different vitolas: Magnificos 5 1/8 x 52 (review by Ed); Sublimes 4 \u00bd x 38; Deliciosos 4 7/8 x 43 (review by Inspector) and the Notables 5 5/8 x 46 which I am reviewing today.The packaging is in the old Cuban style of slab boxes with 25 (cigar wheels) wrapped in a yellow silk band bearing the name Davidoff.I was able to pick up 2 boxes of 4 pack samplers from The Smoking Lamp, Charleston\u2019s oldest cigar shop, while on vacation a couple of summers ago in Charleston, SC.  If you\u2019re still hunting for a nice gift for that family member cigar smoker, these mini 4 pack samplers would be a great idea for overall gift or stocking stuffer.  I know I sure would enjoy opening up a pack of them!On to the review\u2026Short of being perfect the Davidoff Puro D\u2019Oro Notables is covered in a wonderfully silky oily dark brown wrapper and is topped with one of the best pigtail caps I\u2019ve ever seen (well done!).  The pre-light smell is a deep cocoa and barnyard.  The band is not in your typical \u201cDavidoff\u201d style but instead is a very simple solid gold footband with the name Notables imprinted on it.  I actually like this as it makes you pay more attention to the actual cigar than the band.  Lastly, the cold draw, which was loose and airy, contained sugary sweet accents on my palate.During the first third of the Davidoff Puro D\u2019Oro Notables, the cigar produced copious amounts of dancing white smoke.  The burn was impeccable and gave way to a glorious gray ash.  Certainly was medium to full bodied from the get go.  I noted tastes of vanilla bean with a meaty, hickory tone that covered my palate.Into the second third the cigar continued to perform great.  The hickory notes became more direct and a pepper aspect was clearly present on the tongue.  The burn and draw remained great through the second third and the cigar moved back in body to the medium range.The final third of my Davidoff Puro D\u2019Oro Notables turned extremely meaty and heavy on the palate.  Tastes were actually a bit charred and burnt tasting with the pepper notes lasting to the end.  The burn and draw were outstanding through the entire smoke as I never had to pick up the lighter after the initial start.Overall I classify this stick as an outstanding experience.  I do wish some of the overall tasting notes would have offered more complexity however what was there was enjoyable.  I certainly recommend this cigar and for those of you that are not typical Davidoff fans, go ahead and give this line a shot.  It\u2019s certainly not the standard mild to medium bland Davidoff\u2019s some complain about.Pre-Light: 9 pts. Smoking: 8 pts. Overall Experience: 9 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

According to the Ashton website:The Ashton Cabinet is the \u201cWhite Burgundy\u201d of cigars. \u201cWhite Burgundy\u201d gets its rich complex taste from the soil and aging of the grape in French oak barrels. The Cabinet\u2019s 4 to 5 year old Dominican filler blend has a rich, complex and well rounded taste. The extraordinary Connecticut shade wrapper is aged for an extra year and has an elegant palamino color resulting in a smooth and creamy flavor. The Ashton Cabinet includes no less than six different tobaccos and ends with a \u201cbig finish.\u201d Seven years pass from seedling to finished cigar before Ashton Cabinet is brought to fruition and presented for your smoking pleasure.The Ashton Cabinet Selection series is offered in eleven different vitolas.The first thing that I took great notice of in the pre-light ritual was the lightly golden, sandy brown wrapper the cigar bore.  Upon further inspection my eyes found a couple of green tobacco spots and two soft spots in the roll.The Ashton Cabinet Selection No. 6 was topped with a nice round triple seam cap and the eye catching detailed band complemented the cigar\u2019s presentation.  The pre-light smell had a bold sweet honey and crisp bourbon tone with the cold draw showing signs of honeydew and wheat.The Ashton Cabinet Selection No. 6 had a very nice, enjoyable mild opening.  The effortless draw showed tasting notes of oats and grassy wheat.  The uneven burn gave way to a white ash with black highlights throughout.  The aroma for the first third reminisced that of fresh roasting coffee beans.The second third of my Cabinet Selection slowly moved from a mild characteristic to mild/medium bodied range.  The tasting notes completely took a turn with light leather notes emerging and a surprising creamy milk chocolate sweetness as an aftertaste.  The burn remained wavy and uneven, aroma still sensational.Final third of my Ashton Cabinet Selection No. 6 took on somewhat of a stronger leathery texture and was a touch bitter on the resolution (bring back the grassy, milk and cream flavors!).  Cigar aroma remained a pleasing roasted coffee mix throughout the smoking experience and the burn wouldn' straighten itself out (never had to touch it up though).To sum things up, the Ashton Cabinet Selection can definitely be profiled as a mild to medium bodied cigar.  If you\u2019re looking for a nice change of pace from those typical full-bodied \u201cmonsters\u201d, I suggest you give it a try.  I may buy a couple more to pair with a late morning/afternoon latte, but at almost $10 apiece I probably won\u2019t be buying a box of them.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 7 pts.

The My Father Special S is rumored to be based on the company\u2019s very-limited 2007 release El Centurion.  The sample smoked for review was one from a package of three I received after purchasing a box of My Father Cigars. As I began searching and asking for information on the blend, the closest answer I got is that the blend is based off the original El Centurion blend which is a Nicaraguan puro. Interestingly, there are actually two special \u201cevent-only\u201d cigars that My Father Produces; the Special \u201cS\u201d and the Special \u201cS\u201d White Label.  I was told by a very reputable dealer that the \u201cWhite label\u201d will stay an event only release, while you can find a few dealers that sell the \u201cSpecial S\u201d in boxes of three, which retail for about $30 a box.Appearance :  Like a vast majority of the My Father cigars that I have smoked the Speical \u201cS\u201d was near perfect in appearance.

Not feeling like a particularly long smoke I reached for the Don Pepin Garcia JJ White Label that has been resting in my desktop for just over a month.  I had been looking forward to this one for a while because I cannot seem to find enough  smokes in the shorter vitolas.First inspection shows a wrapper that is a bit more vein laden than I would like.  Some of them are quite pronounced begging to affect razor edged burns.  Despite this, the seams are unpronounced and the cap is nice and secure.  Moving to the foot I notice two fairly pronounced dents that can only be described as pencil eraser sized divots.  This leads me to believe that this one is under filled.  Pinching from the head to the foot reveals a solid cigar with slight give.  Unfortunately, there are two very significant soft spots.  One is 2 inches from the foot and the other is right about where the larger band is located.Moving onto the olfactory inspection reveals a fairly neutral smell at the foot.  A slight note of grass or hay is present.  Using my punch to pierce the cap produced two 1/16th inch cracks in the head.  One on each side of the punch.  Taking a prelgiht draw I find it to be quite loose.  In fact there is no resistance at all on this one, almost like sucking through an empty straw.  The neutral flavors from the front come across during the prelight draw as well.  There is nothing very eventful.  I notice a slight hint of cherrywood but other than that not much.Pulling out my single torch I toast the foot and get a few puffs in.  A very light leather flavor comes across.  I enjoy the density of the smoke that this stick is producing at this point.  After several more puffs a tasteful white pepper flavor shows itself but only briefly.  It is at this point that the burn decides to take off on a horrible sprint.  It begins to become quite wavy and visibly skewed on one side.  After much turning and angling I manage to help it correct itself some but it still maintains its jagged appearance.  Shortly after I managed to get this under control a subtle sweet flavor shows up akin to brown sugar.  This smoke is very dry and I find myself reaching for water more than usual.  Grassy tones join the party just under an inch in.At the one inch mark I find myself puffing on a stick that had somehow managed to go out despite my having nothing else to distract me and giving it plenty of attention.  Tapping off the ash I torch the foot again and begin anew.  Despite relighting, the uneven burn remains quite prominent.  Most flavors have subsided at this point except that of the cherry wood, which is still faint.  At about 2 inches in, the smoke again went out; much to my frustration.  We have all been guilty of leaving a smoke unattended or allowing it to go out because of distractions but this smoke does not fall into that category.Repeating the ritual, I get this one going again in the hopes that making it past the halfway mark will solve these problems and somehow redeem the stick.  After half an inch more, I observe smoke coming from areas other than the head and foot.  It turns out that the stick has developed three \u00bc to \u00bd inch cracks in various places along the shaft, thus venting smoke out the sides.  I wrestle with the burn and failing wrapper for a few more minutes and decide this one is no longer worth the effort.  Disposing of it I reflect on what went wrong.Overall, the construction of this stick appears to be its downfall.  The channels, soft spots, and loose draw are all evidence that this stick was under filled.  The lack of flavor may be attributed to that as well but overall it was fairly uneventful and bland.  I really wanted to like this stick, especially after enjoying its larger blue label brother, but found it extremely lacking.

I was a little puzzled in determining the origination of the name mj12 because it\u2019s not listed on the Illusione website, so I googled onward. Well.. the Majestic Twelve happen to be a committee of scientists, military leaders, and politicians whom were charged with the investigation of UFOs. Based on Dion\u2019s other names I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t it, but this is what stogiereview.com lean toward because the shiny foil wrapper makes it look like a UFO; I tried linking it to Christ. The only thing I could come up with was the original 12 disciples of Jesus. This makes sense, because Dion considers the Illusione mj12 a classic connoisseurs cigar, and the 12 disciples were true connoisseurs of Christianity. Let me know if I\u2019m right Dion!Much like the 68 I smoked the other day, I decided to enjoy a cigar while toiling with leaves and branches. A word of warning: a power hedge trimmer can cut through an extension cord while your concentrating on the flavors of a smoke! Though this did give me the opportunity to retest my soldering skills. I was leaning towards LFD Double Ligero Chisel Head, but I had a light lunch and was working with power tools\u2026 bad idea. I still wanted something medium-full bodied to match the crispness of Autumn, so I decided on the Illusione mj12 \u2018The Majestic 12\u2032. It had been staring me in the face for several weeks, because I haven\u2019t tried this vitola yet. Here\u2019s my take\u2026Prelight: The shiny foil wrapper stands out amongst other cigars. According to Illusione, the foil wrapper promotes aging and protection, much like a cellophane wrapper does\u2026it looks cooler though! Unwrapping this cigar is like Christmas, revealing the perfect gift. The gorgeous Cafe Colorado wrapper is perfect, no visible defects, a classic cuban triple cap, and minor veins running throughout. After clipping the head, I took nice draw of leathery tobacco, with subtle sweetness. The draw was a little firm for me, but near perfect. Lighter, meet The Majestic 12!1/3: The first third was hard to detect flavors. There is some spice and some sweetness, but nothing really jumped out at me\u2026just a good ol\u2019fashion smooth tobacco flavor. The aroma coming off this cigar is really pleasant \u2013 very much like other Illusione cigars. The draw is near perfect, and the burn is even.2/3: The burn and draw is still near perfect! A very well constructed cigar. I\u2019m starting to think Illusione has some underpaid torcedors in Nicaragua. The flavors are more defined now, with smooth smoke and medium-full body. I\u2019m picking up smooth leather, a little cinnamon spice, and floral sweetness. The smell of the smoke is better than most cigars, but not as aromatic as other Illusione cigars.3/3: The Illusione mj12 is starting to get a little bitter now with signs of burning tar. However, the slight bitterness is not overtaking any of the flavor, which has remained consistent throughout the entire length. The burn required one touchup after I neglected the cigar for about 5 minutes, but other than that, the burn and draw remained very good.Appearance :  When I think cigar\u2026 this is what I picture. It looks like a real man\u2019s cigar at 6 x 54, and it holds in the hand as such. The cigar wrapper is impeccable, and foil wrapper and band are catchy marketing genius.

The Champion\u2019s burn was razor sharp, straight as could be and consistent, never needed any flame again once the cigar was lit.  The smoke output increased as I reached the wider ring gauge and did become quite thick.  However, deductions were made for the sloppily applied cap, the visible seams and the overall selection of wrapper leaf which, as you can see in the photos, left a lot to be desired.The cigar's brown/grey ash was firm and never flaked.Flavor :  Unfortunately, appearance and construction aside, this cigar failed where it matters most; flavor.I was excited because the cigar really had a pleasing pre-light aroma.  It offered up some very nice woodsy, leathery and earthy notes with hints of cocoa.   The pre-draw had hints of cocoa, leather, earth and dark chocolate. The first couple of puffs prepared me for what I was going to experience the rest of the way ... a predominantly bitter smoke.  I picked up very mild hints of pepper and the flavors were somewhat muted, mainly woodsy notes with spice on the front of the palate but none detected on the back end. The finish was short and bitter.I was able to pick up bitter/dark chocolate notes with hints of roasted coffee that was on the bitter end, almost burnt. The predominant flavors were musty, earth-like.  The smoke output improved but it was a dry smoke with no velvety or oily texture. The first third was uninspiring.The second third offered up much of the same. All I got was puffs of very unpleasant bitterness, dry smoke lacking any texture and short bitter finish with mild spice. The cigar was primarily earthy, grassy and it resembled damp hay.  These flavor notes dominated this cigar. Occasionally I picked up hints of dark bitter chocolate and unsweetened roasted coffee.The flavor profile remained the same as I reached the final third. I did get some hints of toasted/burnt nuts and I got one or two puffs of semi sweet chocolate which were even more memorable given the bitterness I fought during most of the cigar.  There was a slight increase in spice but overall the cigar was mild in this respect. The cigar was of medium strength and should be paired with a sweeter beverage to help with the dryness of the smoke and the bitterness of the flavors. I paired mine with an iced tea having given up alcohol altogether.Overall I would not have finished the Punch Rare Corojo had I not have been smoking it for the purpose of this review.Value :  The MSRP on this cigar is $6.15 and they can be found for less online.  I picked mine up in Chicago where the tobacco taxes are a bit hefty.  I would not spend even half the price of this cigar on it again. There are so many better cigars out there for this price and for less. I feel that when assessing value we must also consider the overall flavor of the cigar.  To me, something holds little value if I didn\u2019t enjoy it.Overall Rating :  (2.20) If the slightly average ratings for construction and appearance weren\u2019t as high as they were then this cigar would have scored much lower.  Keep in mind my flavor rating was 1 which is really all that counts in the cigar. I will from now on give the flavor rating double the weighting in my cigar reviews since the flavor of a cigar is what matters most to smokers.

Simply said, it is all Cuban-seed, Nicaraguan grown tobacco and they all happen to be selected from the same 2004 crop.  It is offered in 4 run of the mill sizes and in three different wrappers.  You can have it in a Connecticut Shade, Nicaraguan Corojo, and a Nicaraguan Maduro wrapper.  I was curious when I saw it was available in a Connecticut Shade wrapper.  Where was that particular wrapper grown?  Do they grow that wrapper in Nicaragua?  I\u2019m not sure but I didn\u2019t think that wrapper type is grown anywhere in that country.  If it isn\u2019t grown in Nicaragua, then that version obviously couldn\u2019t be called a \u201cNicaraguan Puro\u201d but I guess that doesn\u2019t really matter.  Back to the cigar at hand.  For this review, I will be smoking the Maduro variety in the Torpedo format.This one started off like another Perdomo cigar.  One I don\u2019t care for.  There was a bitter and metallic flavor that reminds me of sucking on a penny.  Unlike that other cigar though, this one improved quickly and dramatically.  After a few puffs of that unpleasant metallic taste the cigar became very earthy and leathery with a slightly tannic finish.  Although not a very dynamic smoke I found it to be enjoyable.  The construction was impeccable which is typical of Perdomo cigars in my experience.  The Grand Cru is a medium bodied smoke and easily the most robust offering I have ever tried from Perdomo but even still it falls well short of being full-bodied.  Perdomo seems to be reluctant to make a truly full-bodied smoke, but they did seem to turn it up a notch for this blend.  In the last third earth was still the dominant flavor complimented by notes of black coffee with the finish turning a bit peppery.This was a good smoke and my hope is that the metallic start was just a fluke although it isn\u2019t the first time I have gotten that from a Perdomo cigar.  I plan to give this cigar another try soon.  Outside the first few puffs I really enjoyed it.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Hand-Made Price : $8.95Today's review comes courtesy of Philip a.k.a. Katmancross who blogs at Kohnhed.com. Enjoy!Well, here I am sitting in the cat bird\u2019s seat. I have a cigar to review that the wonderful, and lovely, Abe Dababneh, of Smoke Inn sent me; 2 months before they go on sale.And even better, is that they are Matt Booth\u2019s latest incarnation made exclusively for Smoke Inn, called Big Delicious; which is Abe\u2019s nick name around the shop. This is the 6th installment of their Microblend series. The previous releases are the Tatuaje Anarchy\u2122, Padr\u00f3n SI-15\u2122, My Father El Hijo\u2122, Arturo Fuente Solaris\u2122, and the Tatuaje Apocalypse\u2122. I\u2019ve reviewed all but the Padron.The official national launch is scheduled for April 26th, 2013, at Smoke Inn\u2019s new Boynton Beach location. An already sold out fancy schmancy dinner will occur on February 15 as sort of a sneak peek for those attending. Pre-release orders will be taken on April 5, 2013.The cigars are to be made in one size \u2013 a 6 1/4 x 42-54 torpedo with a shaggy, closed foot.  The cigars will sell for $8.95 and be packaged 15 per box. A box will go for $134.25.The cigar is to be produced at the Tabacos Rancho Jamastran in Danli, Honduras. At the moment, the binder and filler are somewhat of a mystery as information about what is what is still a secret. But it\u2019s been disclosed that the wrapper is a very high grade Habano 2000.A web site has been put together at Room101BigDelicious.com which will be part informational and part fun.On to the cigar\u2026This is a big honker. The Habano 2000 wrapper is gorgeous. A medium brown with hints of reddish hue. The stick is rock solid with just the right amount of give. Seams are tight. And there is no shortage of veins. There is a slight oily sheen. The cap construction is beautifully done. The foot is encased in a very shaggy bit of wrapper. Big Delicious is stamped in silver and red. It looks like a 1950\u2019s diner sign. And then there is Abe\u2019s punum (Yiddish for face) right there; with a devilish look on his face and with a lit cigar in his mouth. On the back side of the band is a white and silver banner declaring \u201cRoom 101.\u201d On the oppoiste side of the band is a caricature of Matt Booth. And next to Matt,  is his dog, Sadie. In the picture, Matt is playing an accordion. Oh God! My folks made me play one as a little guy. I lost all of my friends. You know the saying? \u201cUse an accordion. Go to Jail!\u201dI sniff and detect cocoa, spices, cedar, sweet tobacco, and some anise.Now I clip the cap and light it up\u2026The first taste is a combo of red hot pepper and cocoa. There is a nice wood and leather element. A dollop of creaminess enters the picture. The cigar is burning on all cylinders from the get go. Smoke pours from the foot. There is a syrupy sweetness that is lip smacking good. A bit of molasses.It\u2019s a delicious cigar, and so early. I harken good things to come.Holy cow. I\u2019m less than an inch in and this stick is exploding with flavor. Man, how do he do it? The char line is close to dead nuts perfect. In all cases, the char line\u2019s success is up to the smoker and the method he/she chooses to light the stick. Lighting the foot is almost a science. I believe UCLA has a program in it.I\u2019m an inch in and all I can say is that this is a swingin\u2019 cigar Daddy-O. (I\u2019m old, forgive me).A sweet fruit component shows up. I sit here, smacking my lips trying to discern it, like some idiot. I\u2019m alone so there is no one to point the finger at me and laugh. What is that flavor? It will come to me.The cocoa and the creaminess are raging on a scale of 10.2 on the Richter Scale. The sweetness is so delightful, it\u2019s sinful. I\u2019m a Jew. We don\u2019t believe in sin. Er... wait... is that right? Crap. I\u2019m not sure... will have to look it up in my Jews for Dummies book. After my Bar Mitzvah, I made a dash for it and never looked back.Obviously, the beginning is just a tease. The halfway point will be the marker. This stick is making me a crazy man. How can it taste this good, this early? Abe. That\u2019s how. He and Matt make a pact with Beelzebub.The char line is now dead on perfect. A big cigar like this always runs the risk of a dicey burn. But this one seems to be performing like a champ.The only info I could not find is the amount of boxes that will be produced. The others in the Microblend Series were low. So if that is an indication, these will be low as well and will sell out quickly. I\u2019m already in line to buy my box.I got it. The sweetness and the fruit\u2026 a caramel apple. Yes. I know I will be drummed out of the Cigar Reviewers Union, but that\u2019s what I taste. The sweetness has a definite caramel flavor and the fruit, which is in the background, is apple.The first third ends in a flourish. Spiciness moves to the back. But the other flavors are just building. This is one of those cigars that I define as an \u201cexperience.\u201d I prefer to smoke it alone. No interference. No distractions. I want to savor every bit of the short time I have with it.The second third has finesse written all over it. The draw is perfect. The char line is too. The stick is as smooth as my tush. And the flavors are intermingling with a deep complexity. Instead of flavors shooting at me like a laser show. And who doesn\u2019t love Pink Floyd? The flavors, instead, are making this cigar a bona fide big time player.While touring in England in my band, Curved Air, in 1974, we ran into Pink Floyd at a rest stop they have every 25 miles on the English motorways. We had both finished gigs and stopped for some nosh.We were the only ones in the joint, but between the band and all of our roadies, we filled the cafeteria. We sat there with them and shot the shit and had a grand old time. Very nice, down to earth guys. My band was famous in the U.K. and Europe, and shortly after, the boys came to see us play and jammed with us on stage. Now that was uber cool.Where was I? I think dementia is not far away for me.I\u2019m close to the halfway point. The creaminess is making me lose my mind. I think I just said that in the last paragraph. The strength is definitely building.I just got these sticks. I can\u2019t even imagine what they will be like with a few months on them. The halfway mark is here and the cocoa is now a chocolate soda with lots of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream.The caramel apple component is showing up more convincingly now. This is a first for me. Dried fruit is common. But apple? It has that combo of tart and sweet that is just delicious. Big Delicious.The second third melts away and the cigar has become a behemoth of flavors. Meanwhile, the strength is leaping towards very full.The pepper comes back in waves now. The cap is structurally sound. Not a single piece of detritus has come loose.As I wean off the cigar and the last third begins to disappear, I am stunned by the flavor profile. I\u2019m sure with more humidor time, additional flavors will show up, but what I\u2019m getting now is more than sufficient. The creaminess removes any chance of harshness as the cigar nears its end. I can also taste dark coffee that was somewhat hidden by the power of the cocoa. The spiciness builds up again.I haven\u2019t enjoyed a cigar like this in quite a while. Cocoa and creaminess and pepper and the ancillary components are perfect mates. So my advice to you, my friends, is to jump on this opportunity when it arises. There aren\u2019t many and they will go fast. You deserve a treat like this.Kudos Matt Booth and Abe Dababneh and Smoke Inn!", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/room-101-big-delicious.jpg?iv=16"}, "tatuaje reserva a uno": {"origin": "Origin : USA Format : \u201cA\u201d Size : 9.25\u2033x 47 Wrapper : Nicaraguan Corojo Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $16 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "tatuaje", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/tatuaje/tatuaje-reserva-a-uno", "full review": "Origin : USA Format : \u201cA\u201d Size : 9.25\u2033x 47 Wrapper : Nicaraguan Corojo Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $16 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...Well I decided to smoke another giant Tatuaje. I promise to smoke and review a cigar that isn\u2019t a Tatuaje soon. I know I have been kind of a one trick pony lately with all these Tatuaje posts. I guess it is bordering on an unhealthy obsession. To follow up the RC233 I went with the slightly longer but much slimmer Reserva \u201cA\u201d Uno.This long but slim cigar looked like it was going to take a long time to smoke and it did. Thankfully not nearly as long as a Tatuaje RC233 that I smoked recently. This one was about an hour and a half smoke. It\u2019s a good looking cigar. A little bumpy and rustic looking but still a very good looking stick. I was a little careless pulling this from the humidor and to my horror I dropped the cigar. My heart sank as I picked it up and saw a break in the wrapper. But thankfully it turned out to be a fairly minor scar and it had zero effect on how the cigar smoked. You can kind of see the damage peeking out from the underside of the cigar in the picture.It sports a triple cap like all of Pepin's smokes and the head clipped nicely with my trusty Palio. The prelight draw was perfect and it gave an impression that I was about to smoke a powerful cigar. Well it was more of a medium bodied smoke. It lit nicely and the first 2 inches were dominated by that trademark Pepper that almost all of Pepin\u2019s cigars seem to have. It is amazing the different flavor profiles he can create using just Nicaraguan tobacco and still he somehow manages to have them all start out with that trade mark pepper. Once I got past the first two inches the cigar mellowed out considerably. It was a velvety smooth smoke. It was dominated with a creamy woody flavor with a slight hint of sweetness at times. As the smoke progressed I detected some caramel notes and some flashes of cedar. It picked up a little towards the end as it got a little peppery combined with a toasted tobacco flavor. Overall a very good and complex smoke. The burn was immaculate and the ash held firm but it was a little papery on the edges. A good smoke but not as robust as most of the Tatuaje line. Also a little pricey and a big commitment time wise. I enjoyed it and was glad I tried it but I won\u2019t be reaching for this very often if at all. Mainly because of the size and also because some of the other vitolas in this line are a bit fuller and are better smokes in my opinion. So I think the verdict on Giant Tatuajes is that they are good but not as stellar as some of the other vitolas. I only posted a review on the Regio and RC184 so far, but I would rate the Regio, RC184, Noella, Tanios, and the Havana Cazadores better than these giant vitolas. Of course I reviewed the Reserva SW as well, which if I had to pick a favorite, the Reserva SW would be it. Be sure to try the \u201cA\u201d Uno at least once though. It\u2019s worth it.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Besides, I figured if I was not a fan I could always find another enthusiast who would jump at the chance to try them out.Adorned with the golden Ashton crest, the red and gold striped band looks quite attractive against a mocha colored sun grown wrapper.  Touting the renowned Arturo Fuente figurado shape with a perfecto tip, this cigar strongly resembles its cousin the Hemingway Work of Art Maduro.  Rugged in appearance with light veins and tooth, the overall look and heft of this cigar is quite impressive.Smoothly clipping the cap allows me to take a prelight draw, which is somewhat loose.  Sweet earth and cocoa are accompanied by peppery notes that tingle in the nose.  The sweet earth and pepper carry over into the first few puffs of the smoke as well.  As the figurado burns past the larger shoulder the draw tightens up.  Accompanying it is a lot more smoke and the flavors open up a little.Earth and leather are the strongest tones, tinged with a slight bit of vanilla.  These keep building and at about the 1 to 1.5 inch point it becomes very enjoyable.  There is some cocoa as well.  The ash still remains rather loose, however.  After about another half of an inch I try pairing the Enchantment with a homebrewed scotch ale.  Surprisingly, it makes a coffee flavor stand out even though it was not even hinted at previously.While this cigar is good for the latter half, the initial inch and a half is flat and does not stand up.  In such a brief cigar experience I cannot justify spending ten dollars on only 2 inches of positive.  I am excited that I have a Sorcerer in my humidor waiting because the shape should make the blend and flavors much more consistent and worthwhile.  If you are looking for a VSG I would recommend trying another vitola.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

The \u201cToro\u201d cigar I was sent was actually quite enjoyable, something rare for a new name.  Normally, based on my experience, new cigar companies are either dreadful out of the box or need a few years to turn an average cigar into one with promise.  Very rarely does one come out of the gate with such promise.  I was sincere in my rating of the cigar in giving it 4 stars out of 5 in my review back in August 2012.A month and a half back I was sent a production version of the cigar, fully banded (the pre-release sample came unbanded) so I thought I would give it another try and update my review.The original review is still up and should be checked out for a more in-depth commentary of the cigar itself.  What follows are my additional comments on the Toro from Iconic Leaf.When I wrote that review I commented on the construction of the cigar. I noted that the cigar had a very comfortable draw and the burn was exceptional. The smoke output was nice.  I made a deduction for stem particles in the cigar as noted in the accompanying photographs in that review.To their credit, the fine folks at Iconic Leaf left the following reply in the comments section. \u201cI would like to offer a few words. I would like to clarify something in regards to stem paticles and how they relate to the TRUE entubado method of rolling a cigar. Some have claimed to roll using entubado but in doing so they take the filler leaves and flatten them all together and then roll them all at once like a news paper and that is their version of entubado. True entubado is actually taking each filler leaf and tubing it individually which is what we do. It is very time consuming and you cannot make as many cigars which in turn increases labor cost. In order to roll using True entubado you need enough of a piece of filler to roll it into a tube. with some viso and almost all ligero, which are the smallest leaves on the plant except for the medio tiempo, you cannot do True entubado without using the whole leaf because it is too small to roll an adequate tube with only half.\u201d - Don Jose RaphaelWith that said, I now have a firmer understanding of the process and can forgive them for what I deemed to stem particles.  While I don\u2019t like seeing them (personal preference) I now understand why they are there. I doubt that it impacts the flavour at all.  As such, I think it is only fair that my rating for the cigar\u2019s construction be revised from a 4 out 5 to 4.25 out of 5.Also, I have now had the pleasure of smoking a final release of the cigar.  The flavour as described in my original review remained consistent, which is a good thing.  As a cigar smoker, I like to have consistency in the flavour profiles of the cigars I smoke. I want to know what I am getting when I reach for a particular cigar out of the humidor.I must be completely honest with this review and if there was one drawback with the banded cigars that were sent to me it was with the appearance of the cigar.  For reasons I cannot explain, the production version of the cigars that were sent to me appeared to have more visible veins and the seams were also a tad more visible.  Also, it would be advisable to pay a little more attention to the application of the cap as the samples recently received did not appear to be as meticulously applied as the first pre-release samples.  The band on one of the two retail samples was wrinkled so a little more care in the \u201cdetails\u201d is advisable.  This is important for a cigar company looking to gain the attention of cigar smokers who are a finicky bunch and usually tied to their favourite brands.  Making a stunning cigar, one that smokers want to buy, that shines out from the multitude of different brands is important.  I\u2019m also not crazy about the band of the cigar. It looks a little too simple for my taste.Admittedly these comments may come across as petty but like the food we eat, cigar smokers like to be impressed when they hold a cigar in their hand and these little flaws, while petty to some, are important to aficionados like myself. As such, I had no choice but to make a quarter deduction for the appearance of the cigar so my revised appearance rating for the production version of this cigar is 3.75 out of 5.As far as the taste, arguably the most important aspect of any cigar review, I am pleased to report that the production sample was more balanced and as such earned an increase in rating to 4.25 out of 5 from the previous rating of 4.  The spice that appeared to be overwhelming at times in the pre-release samples was not as powerful making the cigar more enjoyable. I noted in my last review that some of the cayenne-type spice at times masked the flavors of the cigar.  I did not find any such issues with being overwhelmed by spice in these production samples and the flavors discussed in my last review were allowed to shine to the forefront more.  Perhaps the additional rest had a little to do with the mellowing of this. Being quite young, I imagine that some of these more overpowering aspects will continue to mellow.The overall rating of the cigar therefore increased to 4.06 out of 5 on my grading scale which is saying a lot because in my tastings, it still rated higher than the cigar of the year (Prensado Churchill) in the category that counts\u2026 flavor.  The flavors associated with the Recluse Toro are quite enjoyable and deserve to be sampled by cigar lovers looking for something new and something different.I give kudos to the Iconic Leaf Cigar Company.  I really think they have something with the Recluse and I maintain my earlier statement that we can expect to hear some good things about this company in the future as more cigar smokers become exposed to their cigars. They must be commended with coming out of the gate with a very worthy cigar. I was recently sent a couple of samples of their latest shape, something quite different and an invention of theirs, the \u201cKan\u00fa\u201d.  Watch out for this review at a later date once I have had a chance to let these cigars stabilize and rest for a little bit in my humidor.I appreciate reading Iconic Leaf\u2019s comments and your responsiveness.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/recluse-new.jpg?iv=16"}, "cabaiguan belicoso fino": {"origin": "Origin : Miami, FL Format : Belicoso Size : 5.25 x 52 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$8 eachMore info about purchasing Cabaiguan cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "cabaiguan", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["My Review of the Cabaiguan Robusto Extra (5.25\u00d750)"], "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/cabaiguan/cabaiguan-belicoso-fino", "full review": "Origin : Miami, FL Format : Belicoso Size : 5.25 x 52 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Connecticut Shade Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$8 eachMore info about purchasing Cabaiguan cigars...The golden wrapper makes me think mild, but the logo of Tatuaje makes me think otherwise. One thing that is certain is that Belicoso\u2019s are my favorite size and this Cabaiguan is one of the best Belicoso\u2019s I\u2019ve seen. The construction is flawless and the quality of the wrapper is great.In the flavor department you will get some creamy earthy flavors with a slight and gentle spicy undertone. It\u2019s full in strength, but very easy on the palate. The smoke is heavy, but never leaves any harshness in your mouth. I did notice a change towards the end, with tiny bits of Floral flavors, but the dominant flavors still remain creamy And earthy.The way a cigar burns can make an okay cigar good or a good cigar fantastic. The Cabaiguan starts off fantastic and ends fantastic. The burn and draw were perfect through out the whole cigar, which only makes me love this cigar even more.Simply put, I cannot wait to get my hands on some more. The flavors are perfectly balanced and, along with that, you don\u2019t have to worry about the draw or fixing the burn. If you're looking for the perfect smoke for a late afternoon of relaxing, I highly recommend this cigar for you.Final Note: As much as I LOVE the Tatuaje Series P, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the Cabaiguan is my favorite cigar from Pete Johnson.Final Grade: B+This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents. Click here for their latest articles and more information.My Review of the Cabaiguan Robusto Extra (5.25\u00d750)Yet another cigar from the Maestro Tobaquero Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia. He rolls this one in his Miami factory for Pete Johnson just as he does the Tatuajes. This cigar more closely resembles a Cuban cigar than just about any other non-Cuban cigar I have ever seen. It is a work of art. The wrapper is a gorgeous. A rich tan color with the look of expensive leather. The are very few veins and the ones you do see are tiny. It even has a little puckered vein running down one side that I\u2019ve seen on almost every Cuban cigar I\u2019ve come across. And of course like all of his cigars this one is sporting a handsome triple cap. The cigar is beautiful. I even love the band. I\u2019m a minimalist when it comes to bands which is why I am such a fan of the Tatuaje bands. As you can see above, this one is beautifully simple as well.The cigar is well filled and the cap clipped perfectly with my Palio. The were no signs of rib veins anywhere in the head or foot and the bunch looked perfect. The foot toasted evenly and easily as if it knew that this was it\u2019s purpose in life. The draw was pleasant and it produced a lot of creamy white smoke with a rich aroma. At first it tasted peppery which seems to be a trademark of Pepin\u2019s cigars. The pepper quickly mellowed to just a hint and a woody/cedar flavor took over. The flavors were crisp and light on the palate but assertive and it had a long spicy finish. It started to develop a slight sweetness about half way through that was very pleasant but didn\u2019t last long. The pepper started to pickup again a bit in the last 3rd and as I neared the end of the smoke it mellowed out again. It was an amazingly smooth smoke. The ash was perfect, marbled in white, gray, and black. The burn was a little crooked but by rotating the cigar as I smoked I kept it from becoming a problem.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/cabaiguan-belicoso-fino.jpg?iv=16"}, "padron 1926 serie 80 years maduro": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Perfecto Size : 6 \u00be x 54 Wrapper : Nicaragua Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : $32.00 eachMore info about purchasing Padron 1926 cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "padron", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["Nice review, Kaleehb.

Padr\u00f3n\u2019s 80th birthday, the Padr\u00f3n family released its first ever perfecto, the 1926 Serie 80 Years.  With production being limited to 40,000 units per year the 80 years cigars are available in boxes of eight with choice of natural or maduro wrappers.  Along with the unique shape and specially aged Nicaraguan tobacco comes a hefty price tag (+$30).  For most of us this is certainly not \u201cin the budget\u201d however every now and then it\u2019s nice to step out and splurge a little (just don\u2019t let the Mrs. find out).The Padr\u00f3n 80 Years maduro had a lovely box pressed perfecto shape that I absolutely enjoyed.  The wrapper was a gorgeous dark brown with a couple of rough veins running throughout.  The tip of the cigar was well done with a nice even point.  The first band was similar to the rest of the 1926 Series with a very detailed elegant finish and the second band identified the cigar as the 80 Years.  The smell gave hints of sweet berries and earth with a firm cold draw reassuring the earthy notes.The first third of my Padr\u00f3n 80 Years had a tighter draw than most Padr\u00f3ns I\u2019ve smoked however it was still smokeable.  Upon getting the cigar lit up I was hit with immediate tastes of pepper, earth, and wood with the spiciness of the pepper being the dominant flavor.  The 80 Years was certainly starting as a full-bodied monster.  Ash was a salt and pepper mix with a nice full white smoke giving way to a creamy aroma.Into the second third, the cigar backed down just a touch in the strength and flavor profiles however was still full bodied.  The burn remained fantastic with the draw finally opening up to what I\u2019m used to with the Padr\u00f3n brand.  Flavors near the end of the second third started to become smoother with coffee and nutty notes being the initial flavors.  An earthy undertone could also still be found heading into the final third.The final third of my Padr\u00f3n 80 Years maduro carried a powerful nicotine punch and turned from smooth coffee to heavy leather and earth flavors.  If there were any doubts about the cigar being full bodied this certainly cleared matters up.  In fact the Padr\u00f3n 80 Years was on a fine line of being too powerful for my liking however never crossed into the extreme.  The cigar ended with bittersweet leathery notes that made for a long aftertaste on my palate.So was the $30 worth it?\u2026 probably not.  The cigar took me 95 minutes to smoke, which is typically longer than normal for a cigar this size.  I had to pace myself due to the strength and complexity this stick was showing.  It is indeed a very good cigar however I just can\u2019t justify paying this much money for the experience I received.  There are plenty of other cigars that offer the same \u201cflavor profile\u201d and package for half the buck.   In fact, some of those are other Padr\u00f3ns.Pre-Light: 9 pts. Smoking: 8 pts.

The box press has a perfect triple cap and the seams are pretty much invisible. The pre-light draw is Padronesque in its wind tunnel effect of being extremely liberal in delivering a huge amount of air and smoke later on.The burn started off really straight, all the way down to half the cigar, then wavered and went out. The rest of the cigar burned funny and smoke production was spotty and had to be touched up here and there.Flavor :  (3.75) Of course, after the spark, I was hit with a black pepper blast straight to the back of the throat, then some dark berry notes , and then pure sweet earthiness,... all within the first three puffs. The flavor is pretty straightforward of Connecticut Broadleaf, a la Casita Criolla. The spice does seem to linger and continue every couple of puffs. The body of the cigar is a solid medium+ to almost full through the first third. The dark berry notes come and go and I notice a hint of sourness on the palate.Reaching into nearly the second third, I can detect good amounts of subtle nuance. Now this being a pre-release sample, it still tastes awfully young with the sourness a clear indication of its youth. I get hints of the Miami brown label\u2019s licorice, coffee, and dark chocolate notes, and also mixed in, I get flashes of Yerba mate and toasted nuts. I am not totally saying this thing is complex, but with some more down time, there are flashes of promise. The one consistent attribute is the scratchy pepperiness that persists through the stick.The last third is like Pete was taking notes from the Padron playbook (not a bad thing). The body is full now and flavors jump to dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, and touches of herbs. The final is marked by a Graham cracker-ish, malty, dark coffee, and bitter cocoa combo - pretty damn good.Value :  At $13 bones, this is Cojonu!

I really enjoyed most of its straightforwardness and smokeability. I can see a lot of Padron fans loving this stick as it is the closest thing in comparison.With that said, this cigar is just plain out YOUNG. There is a possibility that with another 6 months to a year that this could become a really good cigar (probably not fantastic though). While reading other fellow reviewers' notes on this stick, I think most of us hit the same snag in the construction. There seemed to be a small void half way down the stick in the filler that made the cigar burn funny or it just plain went out. It's kinda disappointing that I have the opinion that Tats don't have the construction they used to, but I believe they are more flavorful than before (better tobacco crops lately? I don't know). Nevertheless I am curious to see where these sticks go in their evolutionary journey from pre-release to full production, and beyond. I would have loved to have given this stick a much higher score for potential, but I have to refrain and just judge the cigar that is in front of me. If everything pans out for the blend, this could be a 4.25-4.5 star cigar. I will definitely be smoking more of them in the future, and I hope you all out there do the same.

The 55 is similar in size to the Shark, which is slightly shorter and a 54 ring gauge.  This cigar also came in a cedar sleeve, which isn't pictured. The tobacco used in these cigars is aged in cognac barrels for 6-8 months.Appearance :  This was a rustic looking cigar, sporting a dark and oily wrapper, and was very firm to the touch. It had a very sturdy head and a large vein running up one side. It had an inviting smell and seemed well made, despite its rough appearance. \u00a0 Construction :  The Anejo 55 had a nice draw, but didn't produce a lot of smoke for some reason. It burned very evenly with a stiff, light gray ash. The sturdy head held up well through the duration of the smoke.Flavor :  This cigar started out pretty smooth, showing off its aged tobaccos. It tasted of black licorice with hints of bitterness and espresso. It produced a very dry finish that reminded me of drinking gin. The taste of anise intensified in the 2nd half with some nice dark cocoa flavors creeping in during the end. Overall, this cigar was fairly complex, but I found the flavors to be kind of boring and unflattering. It was medium-full in body and strength.Value :  MSRP on this cigar is around $10, which I think is fair and definitely worth a try at this price point. However, some retailers price gouge on Anejos, so they may be hard to find at their appropriate retail price. Also, these are usually only released around Christmas and Father's Day, making them difficult to find.Overall Rating :  Meh... that's my attitude toward this cigar. I used to really enjoy Anejo's, this one just didn't hit the spot for me. Perhaps my palate has changed in the past year, maybe this one was just off, or maybe it was the vitola. Regardless, I am in no hurry to smoke another. I find the hype that surrounds these and the accompanying price gouging to be annoying and largely unjustified.

Sometimes people make a false assumption that a cigar is good simply because of its price tag.  For instance, there are many novice smokers that accept as a fact that because a cigar is tough to get and costs a lot of money it means that there is some prejudice to the cigar, with a skewed opinion on it before one even touches flame to foot.  There is an adage among novice smokers, and I\u2019ve even seen it with more experienced smokers that a cheap cigar must taste bad and an expensive one must be pure heaven.If you\u2019ve been smoking cigars long enough you know that you have to get past the marketing hype, presentation, fancy bands and \u201cbuzz\u201d to actually get around to tasting the cigar to formulate your own opinion.  Taste is subjective.  What may be good for one might taste awful to others.  Some prefer sweeter cigars while some prefer more grassy/woodsy cigars.  Everyone\u2019s palate is different but you\u2019ll know a bad cigar when you taste it and usually, you can taste a gem within the first few puffs.With that said, I recently took shipment of some Opus X cigars.  In my humidor I now have the Belicoso XXX and the one being reviewed here, the Magnum O.  These cigars are extremely hard to get.  You usually have to be at the cigar shop when they are released and hope that the regular clientele did not pre-order them.  Luckily I have a good friend in the Tampa Bay area who was able to obtain these stogies for me.   They weren\u2019t cheap, with the Magnum O\u2019s costing $18.00 each.  However, I have seen them at some online retailers for as low as 12.75 which is more probably never going to happen because they are never in stock, and as high as $25.00.  I have also seen them listed for $40.00 or more at some Canadian retailers.I generally have a love/hate relationship with Fuente cigars. I feel they simply offer too much product in their catalogue... for example just look at the sheer number of Opus X's.  I wish many non-Cuban cigar companies would follow the Cuban lead and limit the size selections and make fewer, better smokes than experimenting with another \u00bc inch here or 1/8th inch there. This is my personal opinion but I find that this often leads to consumer confusion. Fuente\u2019s along with Padrons are akin to the Cohiba of non-Cuban cigars. As such, you will pay a premium for them.For the purpose of this review I smoked two of them in the span of 4 days to ensure that I was getting a proper understanding of the cigar.  A word of caution from the outset;  this smoke is powerful. I recommend less seasoned smokers have this one late in the day after a big meal. More advanced smokers know what they can tolerate but I still suggest having a little something in your stomach before embarking on one of these. Also, have your drink of choice handy.  I happened to pair my second smoke with some Port and really found that irrespective of my review, the pairing worked.  So, without further ado, how did the Fuente Fuente Opus X Magnum O fare?Appearance :  (4.75) The cigar comes wrapped in cellophane. The wrapper is a medium to dark brown shade.  It has a nice oily appearance with some noticeable veins and visible seams.  It sports a fairly large cap.  The cigar has some give to it when squeezed but no lumps.

The pre-light draw was a tad loose for my liking.  This held true on both of the cigars I smoked for this review.  This did not cause the cigars to burn exceptionally fast however, but the draw could have been a little bit tighter. The cold draw revealed woodsy hints that reminded me of oak.  It was also a tad grassy.The smoke output was fantastic with clouds of white smoke right from the outset. However, as I neared the final third the smoke output diminished quite noticeably on both samples.  My first one needed one re-light near the band and despite the excellent burn, I was put off by the second one I smoked which went out after removing the band and needed numerous re-lights. It never got me that full cloud of smoke again. As a result, I put it down perhaps earlier that I normally would have.  These cigars need to be smoked at a quicker pace than normal.The cigar\u2019s ash was flaky on both but held firm. In fact on my second sample the ash fell off on its own well into the second third, almost halfway down the cigar. After that, every inch or so.Flavor :  The first few puffs revealed a pleasing saltiness on the lips with some light pepper at the back of the throat. I did pick up a slight bitterness in those first few puffs but it went away after about a cm. The cigar felt quite light at the outset, perhaps because of the looser than normal draw but don\u2019t let that fool you ... I will get into that later.The primary notes were those of earth, wood and pepper. The finish was quite short but the pepper was long, lingering at the back of my tongue and throat in between puffs. It was definitely a \u201cdry\u201d cigar so having something to drink while smoking it is a good idea.About halfway through the first third some cocoa hints were noticeable with the smoke becoming thicker, sweeter and more caramel-like. The main flavor remained woodsy and grassy with some hints of dried fruit at the front of the palate.As I entered the second third, the flavor profile remained the same. Primarily it was earthy, woodsy and had minor hints of cocoa. Some mild saltiness on the lips remained  and the pepper continued to be long in the finish.  A note on the pepper: it was not strong or overpowering like it is on some Fuentes I had smoked in the past such as the Short Story.These same flavor profiles continued through the second third of the cigar at which time I noticed some bitterness creep back onto the palate. Almost like a burnt coffee bitterness. There were more discernable coffee notes as I completed the second third with some sweeter tones akin to dried fruits again but these were short lived and the cigar quickly reverted back its primary woodsy/grassy profile. Hints of mild salt on the palate remained as did the pepper but at this point the pepper was barely noticeable.By the halfway mark I clearly felt the nicotine. This is certainly a full bodied cigar. In my second sample I had to re-light the cigar at the start of the final third and from then on it appeared as though the cigar needed to be smoked quicker than I preferred in order for it to stay lit. This led to some harshness.  It required a number of re-lights with almost no smoke output.  The harshness and bitterness affecting my palate was unpleasing so I decided to put the cigar to rest with over an inch left.  I wasn\u2019t able to nub my first one either as I also noticed bitterness enter the flavor profile shortly after removing the band.  There was nothing fantastic about the flavor profile. Actually I was a tad disappointed.Value :  I can have many cigars with similar flavor profiles for considerably less money and without the limited availability. That's the problem.

Curtis Draper Tobacconist is commissioning several manufacturers to produce cigars for this year, their 125th Anniversary. Pete Johnson, of Havana Cellars/Tatuaje fame, was once again called upon to remake a legendary stick,\u2026 the Cabaiguan WCD 120. This same cigar blend and vitola was made 5 years ago for their Draper\u2019s 120th Anniversary. Those I know of that bought the old 120\u2019s say they have aged like fine wine over the last 5 years, so here\u2019s hoping that this release will be nothing different.

The wrapper leaf sparked right up and released immediate bold flavors of sweet cedar and roasted nuts. Of course, with Connecticut leaf wrappers, there is a sweet vegetal component that weaves in and out of the flavor profile. Amazingly, with a lot of great cigars, clarity and intensity of flavor is key,\u2026 the WCD has both (a sign of great blending). The first third ends with some red pepper spiciness that clings to the back of the throat. This is unique to this stick compared to the other Cabaiguans where smooth dark chocolate flavors usually rule the day. Body is around medium+.2nd Third: Sweet hay, vegetal flavors, and a spicy body is much of what I detect going into this second part of the stick. The smokes power stings the sinuses when retrohaling, a sign of rough youth. Surprisingly the last part of the second third mellowed out quite a bit and hit a sweet spot.3rd Third: Now this is where things get really interesting. Sweed cedar and LOADS of roasted nuts flavors come to fruition, peanuts to be exact. The peanut aroma is unmistakeable. The profile has increasingly become creamy but nevertheless still pretty darn strong- just shy of full bodied. Ends with peanut butter flavors that last for days!Value :  The price point is pretty hard to swallow for a petit corona.

It is the brain child of Philly native Robert Levin.  He partnered with the Fuentes who manufacture many of the cigars that bear the Ashton name.  Known for superb quality and construction on all their lines the Classic seems to be no exception.The Ashton Classic is dressed in a silky, creamy looking Connecticut Shade wrapper adorned by a very classic looking black and white band.  The Ashton name is emblazoned in gold across its face.  The filler looks expertly bunched, almost as if each leaf was placed in position purposefully.  It predictably had a perfect draw.  The flavors delivered by this smoke are a little mild but perfectly balanced making it a very approachable smoke for a beginner but delicious and engaging enough to satisfy even an old pro.  The first puff or two is a little harsh and grassy but it immediately settles into smooth flavors of caf\u00e9 au lait and a subtle hint of vanilla. As I made my way through the smoke I picked up notes of cedar and almond as well as the occasional flash of grassiness, but the creamy caf\u00e9 au lait flavors remained dominate throughout.The Ashton Classic is a very good, very well made cigar.

Arguably the most sought after cigar of 2008, this cigar was originally made as Pete Johnson\u2019s private cigar. It just seemed natural to me (after much internal debate) that I mark my 100th cigar review here at Matt\u2019s Cigar Journal with a review of a rare and highly coveted Tatuaje.   After all, it is my favorite brand of cigar, and I did obsess and dream of the Black Label and its beautiful Jar for 6 months before I finally got my hands on it.The Black Label was rumored to be available only if you met Pete Johnson and he gave you one. When the announcement that the Black Label would be sold to the public in a limited release, packaged in a collectible ceramic jar, the frenzy began. First we were given a teaser, a little taste of what was to come. Many of the Tatuaje vendors received one or two cabinets of 24 Black Label cigars. These were quickly sold off and they served to heighten the anticipation of the release of the Jar. Finally in early 2008 the Jar hit the shelves and I was one of the lucky ones who managed to purchase one.It comes with 19 of the cigars inside, secured with a yellow ribbon and then wrapped in foil. The Jar is a work of art. Yeah, I was/am a little obsessed with the Jar. The Black Labels are still hard to find, but not impossible if you search hard enough. They are even available in a second size now. Black Label Robustos can be purchased in packs of three if you attend a Tatuaje event.It is immediately apparent that this cigar was not designed to be \u201cpretty\u201d.  It was made to look tough.  The wrapper is rustic and bumpy, spider-webbed with small veins.  The color is a dark mottled brown.  It has a rough fuma style head that comes to a slight nipple and the foot is closed with a shaggy bit of wrapper covering it up. And then there is the band.  Simple, black, classic.  It just adds to the toughness of this cigar.  Its overall appearance seems to compliment the look of its creator, Tattoo Pete. The Black Label may look a little rough around the edges, but don\u2019t let that fool you into thinking it is anything less than a top shelf cigar.  It is very well put together.  It burned straight with a firm ash that just did not want to fall off.  The draw was perfect as was most everything about this cigar. Putting the foot to flame you are hit with an initial burst of black pepper that quickly subsides.  Initially the flavors were mild spice and leather with a subtle sweetness on the lips.  This cigar is constantly changing as you smoke it.  I picked up notes of  ginger, oak, earth, nuts, cocoa and an occasional flash of hay early on\u2026 all weaving in and out around a spicy, leathery core. It was a medium to full bodied smoke with a rich tobacco aroma boasting some decent strength, but it isn\u2019t a cigar that will knock you down.  The dichotomy of the cigar is amusing.  It looks rough and rustic but it smokes like a refined and elegant cigar, rich and complex.  The cigar was always changing, always doing something that demanded my undivided attention.This was the third Black Label I have smoked and each one has been better than the last.  I can definitely say this cigar is a favorite of mine and it probably deserves a spot in my Top 5 the next time I update that list.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The cigar builds in strength as it finishes the second third, still remaining in the medium body category.  The final third finishes well, with a long, smooth flavor.

The variation of techniques and origins that come together to create even one quality cigar create a paradise for smokers like me, that are always on the hunt for new and exciting cigars. I have been smoking cigars for over three years with blogging and collecting becoming my focus for the past 2 years. A great cigar to me is spicy, and full-bodied with balance and subtle flavor still present. Unlike those that pair beverages with cigars, a perfect combination to me is great company and a great cigar. Happy smoking.The Gurkha Cellar Reserve line was released as a B&M exclusive last year at the ICPCR show in July. Since then the line has been hard to come by unless you had a shop in your area that carried a decent supply of Gurkha products. Along with the Wicked Indie and Royal Challenge, the Cellar Reserve line was created to reintroduce Gurkha cigars to the public at a reasonable price.Appearance :  The Gurkha Cellar Reserve has a nice oily wrapper with a fair amount of mottling, offset by a large beautiful band that describes the elements of the cigar much like that of a wine label.  The wrapper is rough and rustic with fine dark veins. A perfectly applied pigtail cap and almost closed foot only add to the beauty of the cigar.

The draw was surprisingly open despite the small perfecto sized opening at the tip, and never became problematic.Flavor :  Opening flavors are balanced and rich; there was a strong savory component with dark tobacco and spice lingering on the exhale. The spice faded in the first third, but the cigar built in complexity and richness with raisin-like sweetness, dark tobacco, nuts, and a touch of cedar joining the still strong savory note. As the cigar hit the midway point, the nutty note became the dominant flavor with cedar and leather making small appearances. The final third was an interesting mix of nuttiness and char that although wasn\u2019t the most appealing combination still remained very smooth and balanced.Value :  For the flavor and almost two hours you get out of the Gran Rothschild, the price point isn\u2019t that far off what I would pay for the cigar.

My mission was to review the Winston Churchill. As an asset of The Cigar Spy agency, I promise to respect the A.S.H.E.S. code of honor. The information below is my debrief.Created in honor of Sir Winston Churchill, Davidoff and Winston S. Churchill (grandson) put together this blend with the concept that Winston appreciated the best and finest in life. Blenheim Palace was the location of both Winston Churchill\u2019s birth and marriage.This cigar definitely had me a bit torn. Any company that goes out and names their cigar after one of the world\u2019s most respected leaders (and who happened to smoke an average of 15 cigars a day) and gets the blessing from the grandson of said leader is probably putting out an excellent product. However, when that company is Davidoff, I tend to think of two things when it comes to their cigars: overpriced and overhyped. Even still, interrogation was inevitable for a cigar named one of my favorite people of history.The cigar itself had no imperfections or problems with its appearance. And to my fingertips, it felt correctly rolled throughout its length. The double band, gold ornamented with maroon touches, really gave this cigar an elegant, attractive look.Using a cutter and my butane lighter, my first draw was met with a very minimal amount of resistance. The first thought I had when it came to describing the flavors was simple: mild. An easy-going, pleasant strength to start this cigar, something that anyone could enjoy. Perhaps even a slight creaminess to the overall taste. I was informed by the Davidoff rep I met recently that the mild start to this cigar is because of the Ecuadorian tobacco. He said that the target audience for this cigar was for the European market as they take to a more milder cigar.As the cigar pushed towards the end of the first half of its lifespan, the strength began to increase. A much more pointed tobacco flavor arose moving into the second half. And into the last third of the cigar, a hint of spice hit the palette, making it a nice counterpoint to what the beginning of the cigar offered.Expect a two to two and a half hour smoke time. No retouches or relights were needed as the cigar had an even burn. The ash however, did surprise me with a few gifts of ash on my lap and front my shirt, so keep that in the back of your mind.While I am not a big fan of milder cigars, I did enjoy this cigar, especially starting at the halfway point on. However, I did not like the price. Not one bit. It really kills the cigar. If this cigar was about $12-16 cheaper, I would recommend this in a heartbeat and would smoke these with regularity. If you have the money to burn and enjoy milder cigars and/or the Davidoff brand, you\u2019ll love this. If you are more price conscious, look elsewhere as you can find a similar cigar for much cheaper.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

But even within a particular cigar I found peaks and valleys of flavor, rather than rolling hills.At the light, blasts of white and black pepper smack you on the tongue and in the back of the throat. The pepper really blocked out any other flavors for the 1st third, when it moved off of the tongue and allowed for some light wood to sneak through. The middle third was nothing to speak of, providing flavors of earth and spice, and popsicle stick undertones.The final third is when this cigar changed direction completely. The amount of smoke doubled, and flavors exploded. The pepper and spice completely leaves, filling my mouth with great flavors of tobacco, earth, and something I can only describe as chewiness.Value :  I think $2.50 is a good price for this cigar.

One of my go-to, affordable cigars in my humidor is the Flor de Oliva. I discovered it about a year ago from the cigar chatter via Twitter but because of the price tag (note: cheap), I was a bit wary it might end up like the cigars you see behind the counter at a gas station. Nevertheless, I heeded the words of those I trust and followed through.Giving it a look over, I was presented with a natural, veiny wrapper which I found sweet to the taste and slightly woody in scent. No soft spots detected in the length of the cigar but I did notice part of the wrapper just starting to part away from itself. I will blame this on my humidor as the humidity, while much better thanks to a tip from \u201cThe Great Torpedo\u201d (thanks for the puck suggestion @jcruz), it has been in the depths of the humidor for awhile now. It ended up not affecting the smoking of the cigar or coming apart at all.Lighting the cigar, I was greeted with a slight hint of spice, something that I have come to expect from other Nicaraguan-made cigars. The spice did not hang around the flavors for long, really more of an initial greeting. The flavors from the cigar I would describe as woody and sweet, but not very complex. An easy draw with a lot of thick, white smoke from the cigar. It was also noted that the ash from the cigar had a bold, white color to it. It held well to the cigar, right up to where I gently knocked it into the ashtray. An even burn throughout the two hour smoke time of the cigar.The strength of this cigar I would classify as medium bodied that any cigar smoker could enjoy. I would give this cigar a medium finish; it stayed with me throughout the rest of my evening but I didn\u2019t consider it to be overbearing in any way.You really can not go wrong with the Flor de Oliva. It has a nice balance of flavors that can cater to anyone, both the new cigar smoker and the seasoned veteran. The quality of these cigars is right up there with any of the top brands available in the market, yet you have an incredibly competitive price point that everyone can afford. Pick some up and you will not be sorry.Photo credit: ukcigars.wordpress.comThis post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

It doesn\u2019t take too long though for some sweetness to emerge, combining with the flavors to render them with a different tone.  Eventually some coffee moves in, becoming more predominant around the first third.  Cedar notes emerge from the sweetness, which takes center stage by the final third of the cigar.  At this point the hay and the spice are in the backdrop, and while the coffee has also fallen to the backdrop, there is a butterscotch flavor which stands out above the other notes.  Eventually the flavors all merge into a balanced blend in which no flavor really stood out above the others.  In this harmonious way the cigar reaches its conclusion.Value :  This is a great cigar in terms of the flavors.

At a lower price this probably wouldn\u2019t have impacted my rating as far as value is concerned.Overall Rating :  In general I really did enjoy this cigar, and I can certainly say that a box of these is worthwhile \u2013 but it really comes down to your budget.  At a lower price, say around $10.00 a stick, I\u2019d be much more enthusiastic.  The $15.00 price is quite high for each cigar considering that construction wasn't flawless.  It\u2019s worth pointing out however that this is a Limited Edition, and as such it\u2019s not something you\u2019re going to be able to smoke on a daily basis anyway.  Since it is a special treat, the price is more or less reasonable given the quality of the flavors and aromas.

It doesn\u2019t take too long though for some sweetness to emerge, combining with the flavors to render them with a different tone.  Eventually some coffee moves in, becoming more predominant around the first third.  Cedar notes emerge from the sweetness, which takes center stage by the final third of the cigar.  At this point the hay and the spice are in the backdrop, and while the coffee has also fallen to the backdrop, there is a butterscotch flavor which stands out above the other notes.  Eventually the flavors all merge into a balanced blend in which no flavor really stood out above the others.

It doesn\u2019t get much attention compared to limited editions, but this cigar, produced in Nicaragua by Pepin Garcia on the My Father factory, also deserves a test drive.Appearance :  This light brown wrapper had some visible veining but the seams were compact and barely visible.  A nicely applied cap with a plain looking red band adorned only with the company name.Construction :  The cigar had a few spongy areas to the touch but overall, seemed to be packed well.

The wrapper did tend to crack on occasion during smoking. The smoke output was great.Flavor :  The Tatuaje Havana VI Artistas started off with a lot of spice that masked any real flavour until about 1 to 2 cm was smoked.  Once the spice settled down it revealed mild cedar, natural tobacco, some hints of earth and cocoa.  There was some peppery spice on the finish with hints of leather. These flavors dominated the first third of the cigar.The second third had more leather notes coming through along with more woodsy flavors.  There was a tad more tolerable spice at the front end of the palate with a little black pepper on the medium finish.  For the most part there were no flavour transitions and the cigar remained as it was for the first third.As I approached the halfway mark I got hints of bitter dark chocolate and toasted nut that on occasion tasted like burnt almond.  The cigar was mainly earthy and grassy at this point.  The smoke offered no velvety residue and was dry with no flavourful texture.The final third offered up more of the same with some tea, wood, nuts and slight bitterness.  For the most part though, the final third was like smoking hay. It was bitter and forgettable. It was dry and had notes of tannins similar to those at the bottom of a cup of strong tea.  The cedar-like wood notes at the start were more like plain oak.Value :  With an MSRP of $8.00 it is priced in line with other Torpedos but my recommendation would be to skip it altogether.

This is the same factory the the Illusione and Cruzado cigars are made for Dion Giolito. I mention this because of a story I heard. It is second or third hand so I have no way of knowing how true it is but it is interesting. The story goes that Dion was testing several prototype blends to use in one of his lines. Apparently Dion wants his cigars to change up on him 4 plus times through the course of the smoke so there were several blends that while good, complex smokes, they were passed on by Dion. The rumor is, that one such blend was offered to and subsequently bought by Alec Bradley to become the Tempus. Like I said, I have no idea if it is true or not, but it is an interesting story and maybe it provides some insight into what happens to some of better blends that go unclaimed during the development phase for a new cigar.The large ornate band and the second gold band at the foot of the cigar gives it a kind of regal look from a distance, but up close the cigar looks rather rustic.  The wrapper drak brown and a little rumpled looking with a sparse scattering of small black spots on it.  It is very veiny and has a slight tooth to it.  The triple cap is sloppily applied.  It kind of looks like a Padron, only slightly better put together.  Despite its rustic appearance, it is obviusly a well made cigar as the draw was near perfect and the burn remained straight and even the entire smoke with no relights or touch-ups.This was a nice robust smoke.  It burned slow and cool and took me close to two hours to finish.  It starts off with a peppery blast and rich notes of earth and black coffee and a subtle sweetness on the finish.  It is a full bodied start with a bit of a heady punch.  It does begin to mellow out though and the majority of the smoke is nice and smooth with creamy flavors of nuts and oak interrupted by the occasional flash of salty leather.  As I neared the end, it changed back to the robust earthy smoke that it began as with plenty of pepper on the finish.This was a good complex smoke that was able to hold my attention for the full 90 plus minutes it took to smoke.  I don\u2019t smoke a lot of Churchills because they do take a while to work through so they need to be complex and engaging when I do partake of one.  The Alec Bradley Tempus Centuria fits the bill.  I will certainly smoke this one again.  The Tempus is easily my favorite Alec Bradley cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of the Alec Bradley Tempus CoronaThe cool thing about Tempus line is that it is available in a corona and giant corona size.  Got to love the coronas!This is a dark brown cigar, even coloration on the wrapper and not too veiny.  I punched it and the draw was nice and easy, which is often complicated for non-Cuban cigar manufacturers (sorry, but it is).After I lit it and started writing this review, it went out.  That\u2019s not a good sign.Flavor wise, its not a terribly spicy cigar.  It doesn\u2019t give you much on the palate, but it actually delivers a ton of flavors in the sinuses.  There is an undercurrent of sweetness in the cigar with a richness and depth that shows proper aging.  I pick up notes, in my sinuses, of cherry coffee and chocolate.  The cigar has a nice medium finish.The ash is very short, in fact I have to tap it every quarter inch or so, so that I don\u2019t were it all over my expensive designer cut-off t-shirt.I like the artwork/design on the band but do not like the second band on the foot.  Each band seems to be scaled for the size of the cigar which is cool.  As an aside, what\u2019s up with all of the second bands?  Can\u2019t fit it all on one?I would like to retract my spicy comment, it does begin to pick up some spiciness around the halfway point, not too much, just the right amount of pepper that tickles your tongue and sinus.So with flavor and appearance I was very pleased, but I was disappointed on construction.  So I can\u2019t give this too high of a score but the cigar does show good potential.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/ABTempus_Centmcj-1-450x3711.jpg?iv=16"}, "tatuaje reserva regios": {"origin": "Origin : USA Format : Robusto Size : 5.5\u2033 x 50 Wrapper : Sun Grown Broadleaf Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $9 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "tatuaje", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/tatuaje/tatuaje-reserva-regios", "full review": "Origin : USA Format : Robusto Size : 5.5\u2033 x 50 Wrapper : Sun Grown Broadleaf Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $9 eachMore info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...This year hasn\u2019t been as prolific with the new cigars like last year was, but 2009 has brought a few new things from my favorite brand of cigars, Tatuaje.  This year there are two new additions to the Tatuaje Reserva line of cigars.  Two of my favorite Tatuaje Brown Label vitolas now have a Reserva version, the Noellas and the Regios.  The Regios will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the first Tatuaje I had ever smoked, and it was the first vitola in the brand that I purchased an entire box of.  So when I heard that the Regios was being used for a new Reserva I was predictably excited.The Reserva Noellas and the Reserva Regios use a different wrapper than the standard version.  The regulars have a Corojo wrapper, but the Reservas use a sun grown broadleaf wrapper.  If that sounds familiar it is because that is the wrapper used on the ultra-limited  Monster Series Tatuaje, \u201cThe Frank\u201d.  In fact, these two new Reservas have been dubbed \u201cmini monsters\u201d.  You may also feel a tickle of deja vu hearing about the Reserva Noellas.  That is because there was a Reserva Noellas once before.  Back in 2006 a very few select retailers received without warning a one time run of Noellas that has a Reserva  label on the box.  There wasn\u2019t a Reserva band on the cigars though.  These were the first incarnation of the Reserva Noellas and they were a one time run of 200 boxes or so (couldn\u2019t find the exact number).  This original version was also referred to as a Noellas Oscuro, but I will talk more on that in the near future\u2026\u2026So a quick recap of the current Tatuaje Reserva line.  We have the:The moniker \u201clittle monster\u201d seems appropriate if you hold the Reserva Regios side by side with a Frank.  The wrappers are identical and it really does look like a smaller version of the Frank in appearance.  It\u2019s a dark, oily, and toothy wrapper  with just a couple prominent veins running it\u2019s length.  It is topped with an expertly applied triple cap like all the Tatuaje cigars.  Construction is very rarely an issue with a Tatuaje and this cigar is superbly put together with a perfect draw and a nice heft.  It is dressed in the standard brown Tatujae label accompanied by a second black and gold Reserva band.The Reserva Regios starts off a little different than the Frank or most any other Tatuaje.  It lacks that blast of black pepper I\u2019ve come to expect every time I light up a Tatuaje.  Instead it begins with a mellow spice and a slight sweetness that is common with a sun grown broadleaf wrapper.  It is very, very reminiscent of the Frank.  It starts to pick up quickly, its strong sun grown \u201ctwang\u201d is accompanied by notes of leather and wood.  It has an amazingly slow cool burn that allows the flavors to have amazing depth and balance.  It gets more and more robust as I make my way through the length of the cigar.  The \u201ctwang\u201d remains the core of the flavors ad it is complimented by strong notes of leather, wood, earth, and spices.   Each draw delivers a something a little different than the last.  This was an amazing smoke.  Delicious, complex, and an absolute joy to smoke.  It starts off medium bodied and a little mellow and it just escalates in body and power as you smoke it, finishing off as a robust, full bodied treat.  This cigar is an absolute \u201cmust try\u201d.Update: For the sake of completeness there are a few Tatuaje Reservas that I left out on the list above. The reason for doing so was because two of them were one-time special runs and the third I admit I didn\u2019t know about at the time I wrote this review and I am not sure if it is a one-time run or not, but it is limited to one specific retailer. So the three missing Reservas are\u2026The Noellas I mentioned above and will talk more on in a future review.  The SW Maduro was a special release sold by one shop out west.  Pete made the cigar as a kind of memorial for a fallen friend.  The proceeds or some portion of them went to benefit that friend's family.  The Petite Reserva appears at the moment to be made for one specific online retailer.

Some of these new cigar companies are trying to project themselves not only as a cigar maker/factory but a lifestyle brand within the cigar industry. All of us know the most famous of these brands, such as Drew Estate and Tatuaje. But Pete\u2019s Tatuaje brand and Jonathan Drew seem to be the old players on a team of new school stars which consist of 262 Cigars, 13th Floor Cigars, Viaje, Room 101, and last but not least Panacea Cigars aka Flatbed Cigar Company. Many of the brands stated above have gone \u201cmodern\u201d with their branding even including graffiti in their labeling and merchandise (i.e. \u201cUrban\u201d Cigars by Augusto Reyes and clothing by Tatuaje), modern rock or even hip-hop as influential muses for their cigar creations, unconventional vitola sizes, and even political/social movements in an attempt to break the mold of the conventional cigar brand. Flatbed Cigar Company seems to have gone in a completely opposite direction, trying to keep it \u201cold school\u201d in their vision, but not \u201cold school\u201d in the sense of Cuba, Nicaragua, or Dominican, but instead towards a vision of \u201cOld School Americana.\u201d Flatbed Cigar Company harkens to the historic pasts of years gone by in the country sides of Pennsylvania, and its rich past as one of the largest producers of cigars in the world. Their packaging is unique in the fact that cigars are sent not in boxes but in vintage looking tin cans or old wood crates. Sample packs are packaged in old burlap sacks, and even their clothing reminds me of Dickie\u2019s work wear from decades ago. But don\u2019t let unique packaging fool you, Flatbed\u2019s concentration is on the leaf, and nothing more. Their stated philosophy is \u201cput all the money into tobacco. If we focus on making great cigars they will sell themselves over time.\u201d With good marks from several different reviewers, I don\u2019t doubt their philosophy will hold true.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..on to the cigar shall we?Appearance :  I am a sucker for lighter shade cigars and the Hitch Pin delivers that classic tan corojo coloration.

The first couple puffs my tongue was met with initial flavors of sweet hay/barnyard, earth, and a maybe a touch of vanillin thrown in the mix. Farther down the burn line, into the 1st third, the primary flavors are sweet earth, touches of vanilla, and cedar. Occasionally I would get blasts of floral musk that are commonly found in cigars such as Davidoffs.The 2nd third, the body of the cigar builds and the primary flavors of the 1st third become a little muted. Leather, earth, and even a touch of coffee ground emerge in the 2nd third and the floral musk that characterized the 1st third begins to make less and less of an appearance. Past the halfway mark and closer to the end of the 2nd third, some peppery notes come out with coffee flavors that start to build steam. The last part of the cigar reveals some nuttiness, deep earthy flavors, and leather.This cigar seemed to transition through multiple flavor profiles with the body moving from medium to just a nudge into the full category.

Nodal told Cigar Advisor, \u201cThis cigar is something I have been working on for a long, long time \u2026 Probably the strongest cigar ever to come out of a Dominican factory.\u201d This is why the Aging Room M21 is called fortissimo, which means \u201cstrong\u201d in musical terminology.Appearance :  This is a very nice-looking cigar with a medium brown wrapper and the distinctive Perfecto shape.  There are some prominent veins running through the wrapper.  The band adds a nice touch to the appearance; the brown in the label is only a shade darker than the color of the wrapper.Construction :  Burn is nice and even (one of the most even I think I\u2019ve seen on any cigar), but draw is quite tight starting out.  Fortunately this is a temporary issue that soon passes.  Once the draw opens up, it\u2019s very nice.Flavor :  At first I wasn\u2019t sure if I liked this cigar.  I thought it was a bit bitter.  Whatever that bitter note was, it didn\u2019t last once the draw opened up, and otherwise it\u2019s a very pleasant experience.  Lots of woody notes in here, some leather, and nuttiness.  There is also a hint of hay or grass now and again, and a creamy undercurrent weaving it all together.  As the smoke progresses, there is a hint of spiciness, possibly pepper or cinnamon or both.  More new flavors come out of the woodwork in the final third, including coffee and chocolate\u2014almost like dessert.  This cigar produces a lot of smoke, and it is very aromatic.  As I expected given the fortissimo classification, this is a strong stogie.Value :  There were things I really loved about the M21, but there were also some noticeable drawbacks (that bitterness and the tight draw at the beginning).  I think I would be more partial to it if the price was lower.  Even just a few dollars off, and I would probably have given a 4/5 on value.  But it is pretty expensive, which makes the flaws more significant to me.Overall Rating :  The flavors (after that bitterness) are excellent.  Then again, I have only smoked one Aging Room M21 so far, and maybe that bitterness wouldn\u2019t come up again with another cigar.  The tight draw was a pain point as well though, as is the high price.  The sharp, even burn deserves some kudos, though, and the progression of flavors, especially in the second half, is really amazing.", "flavor": " At first I wasn\u2019t sure if I liked this cigar.

I\u2019ll just quickly thank Smokinson at The Herf Hut Cigar Forum again for his generosity in sending me this fine, aged maduro. I\u2019ll also quickly touch on the fact that this is a cigar with some nice age on it. It has been several years since the Oliva \u201cO\u201d with the embroidered band has been produced. Like most avid cigar lovers, I really enjoy smoking a well aged cigar. So\u2026 let's get to it.The maduro wrapper on this thick double corona is beautiful. leathery with some small veins running throughout, it looks delicious. The cigar is well filled and given its ample size it has a nice heft to it making it nice to hold. The wrapper is applied perfectly but the cap is a little sloppy although I\u2019ve seen worse. It has a very good draw and the foot took a light readily.Right off, this is a very different cigar from the \u201cO\u201d Bold. It is light and smooth and creamy from the first puff. It also has a very pronounced sweet maduro flavors. The Bold started off with a peppery kick. This maduro is medium bodied with nice toasty and creamy flavors of coffee and earth all wrapped up in a great maduro sweetness. It produces thick, snow white clods of smoke and the burn is perfect. I find it somewhat reminiscent of a Hemingway Work of Art Maduro. At the halfway mark it starts to pick up. It got more robust and developed some black pepper which seemed to mask the sweetness. It was less creamy, the flavor a bit dryer but still very earthy. That is how the cigar finished as well. It was a very good, enjoyable smoke that was smooth and well balanced.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

They are packed wet and wrapped in foil with a yellow ribbon around the bundle. Here are some pictures I took back when I bought them. You can click the pictures for an enlarged view.This vitola is reported to be Pete Johnson\u2019s vitola of choice and it also happens to be one of my favorites as well. I love Lonsdales. I think it is just possibly the best size for a cigar. When used with a good blend of tobaccos, the ring gauge and length lends itself to a wonderfully complex smoke with a near perfect duration, about an hour to 75 minutes. I have a hard time picking between this cigar and the Reserva SW as my favorite of the Brown Label line. When pressed I usually end up giving a slight edge to the Reserva SW only because I find it a little more complex.Like almost all of the Tatuajes, it starts off with a full blast of pepper. Once you work your way into the smoke a bit, the pepper calms down a little. I find this stick to be the most \u201ccubanesque\u201d of all the Tatuajes. It is a heavy, full bodied smoke with some serious strength. They are hard to take on an empty stomach. The smoke progresses nicely, first with black coffee flavors transitioning into a rich nutty/earthiness with brief flashes of cocoa. It picks up a lot near the end getting spicy and peppery again with notes of wood. It has black pepper on the finish throughout the smoke.The burn goes crooked every once and while but if you\u2019re paying attention, you can get it to correct itself. The draw is perfect and the ash is well formed. The thick white clouds of smoke produce a room bouquet is very reminiscent of that of a Cuban Montecristo. Tatuajes produce amazing aromas and this one may have the best aroma of all of them.It\u2019s no secret that I am a huge fan of Tatuajes and the Havana Cazadores are no exception.

The unique sweet spice that this wrapper imparts on the smoke is unique and is a flavor I really enjoy. At the start, the thinner tapered foot allows the wrapper to dominate the blend delivering a rich blast of that classic Cameroon with a woody undertone. as I worked my way up to the thick bulge in the middle, the blend over took the Cameroon and all I could tasted was oak with a creamy finish. It wasn\u2019t until I began to work my way back down the taper toward the head of the cigar that I was able to begin to taste the Cameroon again. I was surprised by this and admittedly a bit disappointed since this cigar has Cameroon in the filler as well.The Preferido Cameroon No. 2 is a very good cigar. It is very well made, medium bodied with good flavor. However, I was expecting to be a bit more wowed by this smoke given its reputation and its price. It wasn\u2019t as complex as I would have liked, making it no better than any other quality Cameroon cigar. In fact, I feel there are more affordable Cameroon cigars to be had for less money that can hold their own with this cigar in flavor if not in quality of construction.

Camacho is one of the most sought after Honduran cigar brands on the market.Camacho cigars was founded in 1961 by Simon Camacho and acquired by the Eiroa family in 1995.  In October 2008, the brand become part of the Oettinger Davidoff Group. A few months ago, the whole line of Camacho cigars was rebranded / reblended, in the process some of the well-known blends were discontinued, such as Coyolar or Select. Other lines were not only reblended, but also renamed - this is the case with the Havana. It is now called Criollo. Today's review is for the Camacho Havana Figurado, which was bought before the reblending.The Camacho Havana cigars used to come in boxes of 25, each in its own cellophane sleeve.  The wrapper on my Camacho Havana had a dark chocolate hue with a very nicely rolled cap on the point.  The band was a pleasant yellow and gold, which looks surprisingly great on this dark cigar.  The smell gave way to notes of sweetness and the cold draw only verified the smell with a mellow sweetness and touch of spice.The first third of my Camacho Havana showed a definite taste of honey and oak.  The draw on the cigar was perfect showing just enough resistance.  Each puff proved to be heavy and full of thin white smoke.  The first third did a very nice job of keeping my palate moist.  Needless to say, I didn\u2019t want to lay this cigar down.The burn of the cigar was wavy the entire time and the ash was a layered light gray.  The second third of my Camacho Havana showed small signs of white pepper with a bready, dough like sweetness.  As the cigar burned on, the smoke became a little harsher, turning the cigar into a heavy full bodied smoke.The finish on the Camacho Havana loosened up and became hot on the draw.  The wonderful tastes became somewhat stale and dry on the palate.  All in all I have to say this cigar started much better than it finished however was a solid, easy cigar to smoke\u2026 and enjoyable.  Honestly, I can say I\u2019ve never had an awful Camacho cigar.  The brand all around was very consistent, I just hope it's still the case after the reblends.Pre-light: 8pts. Smoking: 7pts.

They got here a couple days ago, and after some time in the humidor we decided to bust them out tonight.  We had to smoke inside one of the bunkers because of a sniper threat (not many afghans smoke anything other than marijuana here, so a big burning orange dot in the distance is a great target). We really enjoyed them, all three of us.  I personally loved the flavor, the draw was perfect, and the cigar burned perfectly.

My local B&M, Habana House in Austin, had just gotten a new shipment of these in months ago and were recommended for me to try out by Abdul, the manager of Habana House. I obliged due to the fact that the new Le Bijou was in my favorite vitola, a petit or short robusto. I also had to try it due to the fact that the new Le Bijou was sporting the infamous pelo de oro wrapper.

The beginning was very milk chocolately with a floral ending. The floral component is what I get from a lot of the My Father cigars except for those with cedar wrapping. I got some toasted oak and coconut on the retrohale. Smoke was creamy and flavorful. Into the 2nd third and I got a change of flavor to leather, roasted coffee, and a touch of citrus. The pepper blast I was awaiting the whole time hit me in the last third of the cigar and could definitely feel it clinging to the back of my throat. In that last third, the power was amped and now took a full turn towards full bodied, but never relented in producing creamy, thick, sweet smoke. A pure joy of a smoking experience in my honest opinion and probably the best cigar out of the My Father line.Value :  I got mine around $6.50, but see these selling more around the $7 range.

And if you are a fan of the brand, Nicaraguan sticks or a cigar with a bit of spice than this is one for you.I was fortunate to be given a few Toros to review, and I have to tell you, these take the number one spot in the Romeo stable for me.  Right from the get-go, the aesthetics grab you with the white red and gold double banding wrapped around a mocha colored, silky Nicaraguan wrapper that was specially cultivated for this blend.  The pre-light aroma is of sweet espresso.Toasting the foot released a more pronounced scent that added deeper notes of ginger.  But the big surprise was on the light.  The very first puff brought out a burst of cinnamon flavoring that I had not experienced so early in a smoke up until this stick.  It did not last long, but it was a refreshing experience and opened the door for the cigar to begin its complex journey.The richness of the RyJ grew with each puff with robust flavors of nutmeg and mocha becoming more and more potent.  The marriage of these flavors was very pleasant on the palate and left a taste that only lingered as long as it should.  You eagerly awaited the next burst of flavor and anticipated the changes that cycled through the experience.At about the 2/3rd point and through the finish the spiciness came forward and mixed with the deep dark chocolate notes to produce a favorable tang on the sides of you tongue.  I brought this one down to the nub.Do yourself a favor and give this one a try.

Available in only one size, 5 x 50 Robusto, this cigar is now quite hard to find.On to the review\u2026The Punch 10th Anniversary wore a gorgeous silky dark brown wrapper which had only a couple of veins.  The cigar was slightly box pressed and wore a semi sloppy cap. The cold smell was fresh eEarth and the tight cold draw showed notes of fig and tobacco.The first third of my Punch 10th Anniversary opened with a very nice elegant rich tobacco flavor that was accompanied by a creamy, silky smoke.  What a treat!  The burn was dead even the entire first third and the ash a grey and white mix.  This mild to medium bodied cigar was batting 100% heading into the second third.  Let\u2019s see what the next inning holds in store.Into the second third the cigar continued with notes of rich tobacco however was overcome by dry toast and wood notes.  The draw remained tight. Cigar moved completely into the medium bodied range.  Aroma was an unpleasant barnyard, which was a little disappointing.  Moving into the final third the cigar tastes became somewhat metallic.The push into the final third of my Punch Rare Corojo 10th Anniversary showed only heavier metallic tasting notes, which were bitter and acidic.  The burn remained very even and the cigar remained medium bodied.My final impression of the Punch Rare Corojo 10th Anniversary is mixed. This is certainly a solidly rolled cigar and the flavors in the beginning were fantastic, however the terrible aroma and drab finish really hurt my experience with this cigar.Pre-Light: 8 pts.

My initial thoughts are that it is a smooth and approachable stick for any type of smoker.

It is made with a Honduran \u2013 Corojo 2006 wrapper, a Nicaraguan \u2013 Jalapa binder, and Nicaraguan and Honduran fillers. It is box-pressed and has a maduro-colored, oily wrapper that had a little veiny character to it. The body had a mild pre-light aroma with a hint of sweetness and more pronounced aromas at the foot. Interestingly, the filler blend could be clearly seen at the foot as a swirl of light and dark tobaccos. The body was also firm with no soft spots or defects and passed the squeeze test with flying colors.I made a straight-cut with scissors and tested the draw, which was smooth with light to moderate resistance. The pre-light taste was primarily a pleasant tobacco flavor with notes of slightly bitter cocoa. Once lit it started out mild but shortly began to develop a little spice at the tip of the tongue with stronger notes at the back of the throat. It burned with an attractive blue smoke from the foot and a light grey smoke from the draw, leaving a crisp, semi-dense \u201czebra-ash\u201d, meaning it was alternately a distinct light and dark grey in color. The early spice, while the dominant flavor characteristic, was mild to moderate and never overwhelming although it did make retro-nasal exhalation a little difficult. This isn\u2019t a big deal of course and is by no means a comment on a cigar\u2019s quality, I just like to do it in order to try and maximize my appreciation of all a cigar has to offer. As it progressed, the spice mellowed in the middle third and maintained a consistent and pleasant flavor throughout. Once into the final third the spice began to reemerge and progress a little farther along the tongue leaving a mild peppery finish.My overall opinion is that the Alec Bradley \u2013 Prensado is a well made, quality cigar. I enjoyed every minute of it and found it to be a good choice for relaxing alone or with friends. The bi-phasic characteristics of a premium cigar were definitely present in this one and in good proportions to each other.Nice review\u2026now how about that 12yr Macallan in the background!", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/alec-bradley-prensado.jpg?iv=16"}, "cojonu 2003": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Toro Size : 6.5 x 52 Wrapper : Nicaragua Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$12-13More info about purchasing Tatuaje cigars...", "overall rating": " I really am hoping I get a chance to try another of these again sometime soon.

Cojonu, short for cojonudo which is Cuban slang for \"ballsy\", was supposed to be stronger and fuller than other Tatuaje cigars. There were several releases within this line since, which were extensively covered on CigarInspector.com: we have reviewed the Tatuaje Cojonu 2009 twice and the Cojonu 2012 Reserva.When I saw the 2003 version in Brussels, I immediately acquired three of these beauties. Don't get too excited though, the \"2003\" on the band doesn't mean that they were rolled 11 years ago, it's just the year they were blended. Furthermore, these cigars originally featured a Nicaraguan wrapper and now sport an Ecuador-grown leaf. Quite a neat marketing trick!Appearance :  You do not get a finer looking stogie than this.

It\u2019s strong, just as I had expected, but still manages to catch me off guard.  In the first third, there are a variety of flavors working together\u2014coffee, cocoa, wood, leather, honey.  The pepper is still in the foreground, however.  The same flavors remain prominent during the middle third, but the pepper drops back a bit and the profile is more balanced.  There is some solid gray ash hanging on, and still a lot of aromatic smoke.  In the final third, the pepper comes back with a rich earthy backdrop.The honey I smelled so prominently on pre-light is not nearly as prominent as I would have guessed, but now and again I catch a faint whiff of its sweetness lingering in the backdrop.  Even though the same flavors play off of each other throughout the smoke, they are continuously shifting and changing, which makes for some great variety.Overall Rating :  I really am hoping I get a chance to try another of these again sometime soon.  This is a medium to full-bodied smoke, and both the strength and the flavors are potent, so be ready for that.

I had three in my humidor which were given to me by a close friend of mine, and I had enjoyed all three tremendously.  I smoked the last one in order to write this review.  The cigar (when available) can be found in four vitolas:  a Robusto (5.5 x 52); a Torpedo (5 X 54); a Toro (6.5 X 52); and the subject of today\u2019s review, the Toro Grande, a 6 x 58 masterpiece.I looked in several websites to track down who carries it and how much are they running, but it was difficult to find a retailer that had them in stock.

This vitola of the Nording seem to be double capped.The bands were easily removed from the cigar.The cigar fit very nicely in my hand, and it was very comfortable during the smoke.The burn was very even for the entire smoke; I was able to get about an inch of charcoal grey ash before, unfortunately, it fell in my lap.Flavor :  The wrapper and the foot had a very earthy and barnyard smell to it.  Once the cigar was cut with a Palio cutter, the pre-light draw had a honey and sweet taste to it.  The draw was very good for such a solid cigar.  The cigar had a spicy taste to it prior to lighting it up, and the spicy taste seem to last for a few minutes before dissipating.After lighting the cigar, the initial draw and retrohale had a roasted nut and roasted coffee taste.  These were very pleasant.  About an inch into the cigar, some leather notes were present.  It had a nice, long finish, which got even longer for the second half of the cigar.The cigar\u2019s smoke was very abundant which rose very quickly.All throughout the cigar, all flavors were very balanced and very pleasant.  The cigar was definitely a medium body, very pleasant full flavor cigar.Value :  Since the cigar was given to me by a friend, it was definitely of great value for such a quality smoke.  However, at around $92.00 for a box of 20, it is an incredible value.  The Toro Grande was a good 1.5 hr smoke, so if this is factored into the value of the cigar, it is a great stick.

I do know that these cigars are blended by Jaime Garcia at the My Father factory.

What little pepper that was present was backed by baking spice. Nuts and earth emerge next, but nothing quite impressive and I am in a lull from the beginning. The smoke is dry and sucks the moisture out of my mouth, but has a slight sweetness to it. Possibly a touch of clove came out near the end of the 1st third. In the sweet spot of the cigar, I got heavy amounts of nuttiness and wood flavors, and the baking spice component has dialed back a bit. The smoke is creamy and smooth,\u2026 quite enjoyable I might add. The last third mellows out in intensity of flavor (not that there was a whole lot of flavor to begin with). The cigar didn\u2019t evolve enough for me to really want to get to know it and appreciate it.

The Don Carlos is a superbly constructed refined cigar that proudly bears the name of Don Carlos Fuente Sr. himself. The Don Carlos can be had in various vitolas, seven of which are the most common. The #2, #3, #4, Robusto, Double Robusto, Belicoso, and Presidente. I have seen pictures of a Lancero but have never seen one in person. I don\u2019t know the story behind the Lancero but can only assume it was some kind of special run that may or may not have ever been publicly available. The Fuente\u2019s seem to have a lot of special run, never released cigars floating around out there. You often hear stories of them much like you hear stories of Big Foot and Lochness sightings.But I digress. Today I am smoking the Don Carlos No. 4. It is a handsome looking Mini Belicoso in a toothy, brown Cameroon wrapper that shimmers with an oily sheen. The Mini Belicoso is unique. The cigar is the size of a Petite Corona but with the tapered bullet head of a belicoso. The wrapper tastes sweet on the lips and the draw seems to be about perfect with just the right amount of resistance. Right off the bat it delivers a nice strong abundance of Cameroon sweet spice. This is one of the smoothest and most refined Cameroons I\u2019ve smoked (true of Don Carlos in general). I am a lover of Cameroon wrapped cigars so I really enjoyed this. The flavor was pretty consistent the whole way. This size is a little stronger and more robust than the larger vitolas in this line. There is a little pepper in the background and the finish is surprisingly light and pleasant. The construction is impeccable and the burn is perfect. Given the small, short format of this cigar, the lack of complexity really isn\u2019t a problem. It is the perfect smoke if you are looking to get a lot of straight forward, classic Cameroon flavor.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of the Arturo Fuente Don Carlos BelicosoSo if you know me, you know that I am not a huge Fuente fan.  I find them to be over hyped on average and overvalued.  Unfortunately this Don Carlos Belicoso is no exception.I love Cameroon wrappers, and very few manufacturers do as much with Cameroons as the Fuentes.  The funny thing is the only Cameroon that I like from them is the redonkulously priced Casa Fuente.This stubby torpedo has a beautifully dark and satiny Cameroon wrapper that does in fact make you mouth water.  But the happiness for me ends at the appearance.As soon as I clip the cigar I note that the draw was tight and after lighting, the burn was uneven.This nice looking cigar\u2019s flavors were muddled from the get go.  I first got notes of  oak and pepper, but there was a  little bit of greenness to the cigar that made it seem like it\u2019s fermentation was rushed.The flavors to me never developed, this was not good for the money.  The finish was harsh and I had to fight the burn and draw the entire cigar.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/Arturo-Fuente-Don-Carlos-No.4-450x3371.jpg?iv=16"}, "cumpay robusto": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Robusto Size : 115 x 19.8 mm Ring : 50 Wrapper : Nicaragua Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Drink : Mojito Price : 6\u20ac each", "overall rating": " As you have probably understood, I really enjoyed the Cumpay Robusto.

The label has a sophisticated look that makes this cigar seem like a gentleman\u2019s cigar. Along with its classy look, the wrapper is smooth and the construction is very strong.The wrapper also gives off a scent of soft fruit and rich tobacco. The foot smells pretty much the same, but with a little more aroma. I cut the cap to check the pre-draw and the draw was good. It also left a gentle pepper and plumy flavor on my palate. At this point, everything is good, the construction and quality of the cigar is definitely there. So let's find out what kind of flavors this Davidoff has to offer.The Davidoff stars with a buttery raisin, sweet floral and earthy undertone. It\u2019s very smooth and the smoke is very light, but leaves plenty of flavors on your palate. As I kept smoking, that buttery sweetness fades away slowly and by the time I reached the second third of the cigar, it became very rich in nuttiness. The way this cigar blends from the first to the second third is extremely enjoyable and works very well. By the time you reach the end, the cigar doesn\u2019t change in flavor. It remains nutty with a soft earthy undertone and best of all, its remains very smooth. I have to mention one thing that makes me extremely happy. There is absolutely no pepper and no spice in this cigar! YAY!As fantastic as the flavors in the Davidoff are, I do have one problem, the ash. The ash is extremely flaky, messy and it goes all over the place. Honestly, it's very annoying. If this cigar didn\u2019t taste so good, I probably would\u2019ve put it down because of the ash. The draw and burn was perfect, so I really didn\u2019t understand the problem with the ash.Besides the very annoying ash, this cigar is one of the best medium bodied cigars I have smoked. The balance and different flavors are very enjoyable, the taste is great and except for that tiny little problem the quality is very good. Yes, I would definitely smoke this cigar again. Its perfect for a afternoon of relaxing and I recommend this cigar to anyone.Final Note: This was my first Davidoff and it was a great one. The ash is one thing, but there\u2019s something missing from this cigar to put it in that \u201cwow\u201d list. Which is what I look for in a cigar to give a perfect grading. Because of that, I have to hold back from the A and give it a slightly lower grade. It\u2019s still a great smoke and you have to give it a try.Final Grade: B+This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

The wood notes are still there but take a backseat to the meat. The body is a definite medium+ to full. I am amazed by how much flavor there is but it's not overpowering.3rd Third: The last third seemed like I was smoking an old 2x4 wrapped in jerky,... in the best way possible. Not a lot of flavor change but more flavor intensity. The body has definitely ramped up to full and tastes very Padron-esque.

I gave a rundown of the outfit in my review of the Panacea Black Natural that I posted recently.  Give it a read if you need or want to know more about them, or just visit their website.  The Black label line was their first, initial release with an Ecuadorian grown Connecticut Shade wrapper.  The line was quickly expanded to include a maduro-wrapped version of the blend.  That is what I am smoking today.This Panacea Black actually is a torpedo as opposed to the Natural I smoke in which I thought it was a torpedo, but in actuality it was their version of a perfecto.  The Maduro is wrapped in a dark brown, mottled maduro leaf with some fine veins running across its surface.  The Maduro wrapper doesn\u2019t do much to bolden this blend but it does have a bit more body than the natural.  What you end up with is a very nice, creamy, mild smoke.  Notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and earth are complimented by a subtle sweetness typical of a maduro smoke.  Again, like the natural it is a fairly simple and straight forward smoke with well defined and well balanced flavors.  It is consistent from start to finish.  There is a little spice that shows up in the last third giving the smoke a bit more oomph and that made for a very nice conclusion to what was a very good smoke.  Construction was excellent with a great draw and an even burn.I think the Panacea Black is another fine cigar from the Flatbed Cigar Company.  I enjoyed it more than most maduros I\u2019ve smoked, but of the two versions of the Black, I think I prefer the natural.  That said, I would certainly enjoy smoking another maduro anytime.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

That\u2019s what JD, Jonathan Drew (yea, we\u2019re tight like that\u2026 not really), calls his My Uzi Weighs A Ton creation for short.  As I am quite sure everyone has figured out, JD is much more \u201cwith it\u201d than other cigar makers, therefore, good for you JD for giving this beast such a moniker.   MUWAT was JD\u2019s personal blend, so I certainly had high expectations for this thing, and I have been chomping at the bit to get my hands on it.Aromatically, the MUWAT doesn\u2019t offer much.  The faint aroma that it does emit is bland and disappointing.  Fortunately, it\u2019s attractive, which makes up for its lack of aromatic character.  The San Andreas wrapper is beautiful, oily, and moderately veiny.  Banded with a rather gimmicky band, it certainly catches your eye.  The MUWAT is only sold in bundles, but dealer presentation is modestly cool, as it is displayed in a box that features all three sizes.Upon lighting the MUWAT, don\u2019t be surprised when it goes directly for the gut.  It packs quite the nicotine punch, but starts out with little complexity.  Spectacular, big, and satisfying, are the best words to describe the draw on this big gauged stick.  Fortunately, it gains complexity after about the first inch.  You will notice hints Brazil nuts, cashews, white gravy, and lots of coffee.  I found the Brazil nut flavor interesting, since the filler is Brazilian mata fina.  Things were really beginning to look up.Going into the second third, the burn gets wacky, and extremely uneven.  However, the flavor gets awesome.  Things get really smooth and malty, bringing more intense coffee flavors, and a little leather.  Unfortunately, this thing cracked like the Grand Canyon.  I decided to inspect, and I found that it was the result of a binder issue.  The Connecticut capote binder had a huge void about 2 inches long, and about a sixteenth of an inch wide.  What a freakin bummer.Long story short, if you want something done right, you should probably do it yourself (especially when it involves your personal blend).  The smoke was no doubt, great!

This cigar is a medium to full body stick, slow burning, offering a plentiful volume of smoke for about an hour which makes it a great afternoon or evening smoke.  They are good to go right off the truck but do get even better with age. I think the thinner ring gauge enhances the flavor of the maduro wrapper which I personally prefer over the natural.  Even though my comfort zone is around a 50 RG these smokes really hit home and at the price point they just can\u2019t be beat.  At just under $3 a stick at my local B&M, I always pick up a few when I\u2019m there to have them on hand!The cigar once lit, opens right up with a rich maybe dark roast or espresso coffee flavor complimented with a nice cocoa overtone.  The smoke is very smooth and easy on the retrohale in which I sometimes detect a slight nutty flavor, usually in the first third.Entering the second third, the cigar picks up a little adding some more cocoa to the mix along with a rich dark tobacco undertone.  The retrohale starts to introduce a just little spice at this point but it\u2019s pleasant and not the least overpowering.  The ash is a light to medium gray and holds on fairly firm revealing a nice conical shaped cherry when tapped off.The final third reveals more of the same never getting hot or harsh right down to the very nub.  The cigar burns well from start to finish and I never felt the need to touch one up.  The draw is typically perfect from stick to stick.  This cigar is one that is very consistent, really delivers and at this price point I don\u2019t see my humidor ever being without them.

Through word of mouth and some generous brothers of the leaf I was able to acquire a few of the 262 Paradigm Toros. The 262 brand is quite unique with a more modern style of approach to advertising being highly social media friendly, with word of mouth as key to getting this product in the mouths of cigar smokers.

Its smooth wrapper is milk chocolate in color.  The foot is wrapped in a dark brown paper adorned with the Rocky Patel \u201cRP\u201d logo and the head is decorated with a dark brown band trimmed in gold.  They sport a pretty severe box press, and you can get them in a box of 20 or a cedar chest of 50 cigars.  They are also available with a very dark Maduro wrapper which I will review next week and they come in three basic sizes.  Unfortunately (to me anyway) they are sizes that have become cliche in the US:This corojo has a nice rich tobacco aroma which got my hopes up.  Then after clipping the head, my test draw revealed an extremely loose draw that tempered those hopes quite a bit.  I lit the cigar and drawing on it was like sucking air through a giant straw.  It provided no resistance at all which made me worry it would burn way too hot so I made a point to go slow and sip at this cigar.  Despite my diligence the draw was a little problematic.  I occasionaly got very bitter and harsh blasts to my palate that I attributed to the cigar heating up too much.  In between there were some very pleasant notes of nuts and coffee but they were sometimes accompanied by a sour finish.  If there was any complexity to this cigar at all it was lost with problems I had in keeping it from overheating.  I have one more of these in my humidor so I\u2019ll give it one more shot even though I didn\u2019t see much promise in this cigar even when I was able to taste anything other than the bitter harshness.

Enjoy!Well, being that this is our first article I would assume that a short introduction is in order.  My name is Nicholas Tolla, Jr. and my Fathers name is Nicholas Tolla, Sr., collectively known as The Tollaficionados.  For well over 20 years we have been sharing quality time together with a fine cigar in hand.  It is the pinnacle of Father & Son time for us.  We sit back, enjoy a quality smoke and discuss anything that comes to mind.  Quite often our minds are on the cigars.After all the time that we have spent with the tobacco gods, and all of the people that have come to us asking our opinions on various smokes, we have decided that it is about time to put pen to paper, (or finger to keyboard if you will) and give everybody that is interested our take on some of the many cigars on the market.  Yes, there are a lot of people out there giving their opinions on the quality and enjoyability of the stick-of-the-day, but we want to take a slightly different approach to the task at hand.  Let me explain\u2026I will preface this by stating that I mean no disrespect to those who explain their smoking experience differently than I do.  In fact, I thank all of them for the variety of phrases and unique (sometimes outright abstract) descriptions that I have read.  We will do our very best to refrain from orange peel and nutmeg undertone phraseology.  They don\u2019t put it in the tobacco, and I won\u2019t put it in my articles.  I have not recently been kicking back to enjoy a $10 Dominican Maduro, to all of a sudden find myself chewing on a peanut or some toast that magically appeared in my mouth as a result of the cigar I picked to smoke.  I am not going to tell you what I think I taste in the form of a food, drink, herb or otherwise.  You won\u2019t be able to find the same thing no matter how far into the depths of my handy thesaurus I go.  So I won\u2019t do it.  Let\u2019s cut to the chase here.  Words like sweet, spicy and bitter will work fine for all of us.  Connoisseurs and novices alike can enjoy a layman read, and probably relate to it better than most of the other summaries out there.We will tell you what we think throughout the duration of the smoke, and give the cigar a rating from 1 to 10 (10 being the best)  OK.  Enough of that.  Let\u2019s get started with our first Father & Son rating with the line of cigars called Jose Carlos.The Jose Carlos line is named after an orphan from Nicaragua that so impressed the owner of this cigar brand that he named them after this child who always seemed to find the brighter side in things.  Consisting of three blends and only one size, we felt that this brand would be a good place to start this little adventure.  There is a Habano, a Connecticut and a Corojo, all are 6 inches with a 52 ring.  They come 26 to a box.  With a philosophy of \u201cDo things right, not fast\u201d being the way they describe the quality of their product, let\u2019s see if they hit the proverbial bulls eye.   Please follow us into the lounge won\u2019t you?First up, the Jose Carlos Habano.  This cigar is a blend of long filler tobacco (and a touch of some that has been specially aged) from the three growing regions of Nicaragua.  The wrapper, also from Nicaragua is Sun Grown Habano.At face value the cigar seemed to be well made.  It had a mild aroma to it and a sturdy looking cap.  A very smooth, dark brown leaf rounded out the aesthetics.  When putting cutter to cap \u2013 eureka! - it held up just fine.  Now the fire\u2026Upon lighting this cigar it put out a cool smoke that had a bit of tang to it.  (Can I say tang?  Am I breaking my own rules?  Well deal with it!)  It almost immediately turned bitter.  This bothered Nick Sr. more than myself in that his palate and the back of his tongue held onto the bitterness far longer that it should have.  I just didn\u2019t particularly care for the taste.  Not a stellar start.  There were no draw problems, but will that be enough to resurrect our opinions?As the cigar reached the end of its first third, its light grey ash held tight.  The body of the cigar began to soften from the increasing heat felt right through wrapper.  The taste at this point could be called mild.  Not exactly what you would expect from a Habano looking like this.  From this point on, the cigar did build in strength and flavor.  I\u2019m not saying that we completely enjoyed the flavor, but it DID improve.  It just wouldn\u2019t lose that annoying aftertaste for either of us.  And on top of that, it began to burn unevenly.  Very unevenly.  Canoe unevenly.I refrained from touching it up with the torch to see if it would correct itself in time.  It did, but that didn\u2019t make up for the heat that this stick was beginning to pump out or the thickness that we both felt on our tongues.  We agreed that we didn\u2019t want to get our stinky food holes too close to anybody in the immediate future.And the finish.  Much like the rest of the experience.  A continued, lingering bitterness on the tongue and palate, though softened slightly as time passed.  Slightly more flavorful and a whole lot hotter right to the end.The Ranking:  We give it a 5.  As much as we complained about some of the qualities of this cigar, it wasn\u2019t completely repugnant.  There were some periods that we put the bitterness aside and just enjoyed the act of smoking and tried to fish for the good things that the Jose Carlos Habano could provide.  We have had worse in the past, but we have had a lot better as well, so a 5 will have to do for this one.Come back next time when we rank another cigar.  Who knows, you may even see the other two Jose Carlos sticks in the future.

Keep in mind that taste and flavor is purely subjective and no two palates are alike.  I would be lying if I simply wrote a respectable review and feel that it is important to at least get my impression of the cigar written in an honest manner.  Good or bad, I encourage anyone interested in the cigar who hasn\u2019t tried it to at least give it a try.  Don\u2019t let my review of the cigar put you off on trying one if it is truly what you want to do.  This is what makes the hobby fun: comparing each other\u2019s experiences.The pre-light aroma provided some cedar, mint, tea and earthy aromas. The pre-light draw was good and offered up earthy notes with a touch of peppery mint and some mustiness.The cigar lit well and gave off some thick clouds of smoke.  The flavors were a tad muted on lighting which was surprising given the pleasant aromas the cigar had when unlit.  There was some mild pepper on the tongue but this was very subtle. The first flavors that hit me, in order, were must, wood, earth and a faint hint of tea on the finish.  It had a long woodsy/musty finish with barely any spice. As I reached the end of the first third a little more pepper came into the flavor profile and while no particular flavour changes caught my attention during the first third, the peppery finish got noticeably longer as I smoked it. The spice wasn\u2019t really \u201cpeppery\u201d but more of a subtle background \u201cspice\u201d.The draw gained a little more resistance as I approached the second third.  The smoke remained thick but the smoke\u2019s texture was quite dry, leaving no flavourful residue on my palate. The primary flavors remained earthy and woody with hints of unsweetened coffee and cocoa entering the profile here and there along with some bitter citrus flavors. I also picked up the occasional but very brief toasted nuts and leather. I did pick up some semi-sweet chocolate in the smoke near the halfway point but this was not very long lasting at all. While the cigar\u2019s smoke did leave a slight residue on my palate at this stage of the cigar, overall it was quite dry.  It was also a tad on the bitter side.As I reached the halfway point, the cigar offered up pretty much the same flavors noticed in the first half.  The sweetness was gone from the smoke and other than the transition to a more neutral smoke texture, the overall flavor profile remained the same.  Strength was definitely there and although this cigar is marketed as medium strength, I would tend to lean to the stronger end. All in all, the flavors, while noticeable, were not that really enjoyable with a very noticeable mustiness and earthy profile dominating the cigar.The final third offered more of the same. The smoke output decreased and the draw opened up a bit too much. The cigar became even more bitter as I approached the band.   For the most part the  flavors had absolutely no transition at all.  I don\u2019t have any particular problem with a one dimensional smoke if the flavors I am getting from a cigar are enjoyable. I cannot say that for the Black Market Torpedo.  Perhaps a little age might help this cigar sweeten up a bit but for what I got out of my tasting, I was rather unimpressed and would rather spend my money elsewhere.Value :  This cigar\u2019s MSRP is $7.90.

To be quite frank, I question how popular this cigar (which reportedly sold out on release) would have been if not preceded by the AB Prensado cigar of the year award that pre-dated this.I\u2019ve been smoking cigars for over 20 years.  No more than over the past few years have I noticed cigars marketing become more prevalent than it has today.  From fancy creative packaging to all kinds of promotional events attached to releases.  This cigar, with its wooden crate style box and extra protective sleeve is a prime example of additional costs that are passed on to the consumer. Even if only minimal, they do add to the price. There is nothing wrong with simply packing cigars in a cigar box and letting the taste of the cigar speak for itself. These little things annoy me because they ultimately impact the cost of the cigar and as smokers will note, this is becoming a more expensive hobby by the day.  As companies jump over each other to release the next \u201cbig thing\u201d, far too much money is spent (in my opinion) on marketing and fancy packaging when really, all the cigar smoker wants is a fine tasting cigar.  However, it is the glitz and glamour that usually attracts one\u2019s eye at the cigar shop and unfortunately, this sometimes gives a cigar a reputation it doesn\u2019t deserve.Like I\u2019ve written in my other reviews, the fact that a cigar doesn\u2019t change flavors, or remains one dimensional is not something to get overly worked up over so long as the flavors are enjoyable during your smoking experience.  Where this cigar fails in my view is that while it remains one dimensional, I did not actually find the cigar\u2019s flavour profile to be overly appealing or enjoyable. In fact had I not been smoking the cigar for the purpose of a review and taking notes while smoking it, I would probably have put it to rest a lot sooner than I did.  The mustiness and dry flavors dominated the cigar and were not particularly enjoyable.It\u2019s about time someone calls these cigar manufacturers to task for inflating the price of the cigars to pay for the price of the packaging. It seems that nowadays the competition is in the packaging at the expense of the contents.I\u2019m guessing that they are either trying to impress the uneducated smoker with fluff or just trying to get top billing on the B&M shelves. Rather than trying to outdo each other with expensive boxes, magnets, plexiglass, flowery bands and ribbons maybe the manufacturers could just put out top notch cigars that don\u2019t need cutesy packaging to  disguise an inferior product.", "flavor": " This review might be a tad controversial only in the sense that I know there are a lot of Alec Bradley fans out there.

The Leccia Black is one of a duo of \u201cBlack and White\u201d cigars, the other of course being the Sam Leccia White, made in Nicaragua.  The Black is manufactured in the Dominican Republic, and comes in four sizes: Corona, Robusto, Toro, and XO (Gordo).

The majority of cigars are made with air-cured tobacco.  Fire-curing removes moisture and is generally used for pipe and chewing tobacco.  This process results in a \u201csmoky\u201d flavor.

I mostly noticed the smokiness on the retrohale.  The natural tobacco definitely is the primary flavor.  For some reason I expected this one to stay spicy, but the peppery notes actually fall away in the middle third, and are replaced by sweet flavors.  I am also getting hints of anise.  In the final third, the flavors all kind of even out in intensity, with the smokiness coming to a fore.  I was able to smoke this one right down to the nub without any harshness or heat.

But yet again, here comes another one, the \u201cC-4.\u201d At this point in the year, I have been pretty disappointed in a lot of the Viaje releases. Some felt as if they were released too young and some were just plain terrible. But Andre has a way of keeping his followers' eyes peeled for that diamond in the rough. Every once in awhile he hits a homerun and I was hoping to find it possibly in this cigar.The C-4 was released back in mid-June along with some other annual Viaje summertime releases: the TNT and Summerfest. Only 3,750 total cigars were made. As much of you all know, Andre only specializes in small batch, hard to find cigars.Appearance :  The C-4 has a very oily, might I say juicy, looking wrapper.

Once lit the C-4s produced good amounts of thin smoke, but were plagued with burn problems. Most of my samples only wanted to burn down one side or the other. Dry boxing these well might solve a lot of these burn problems.Flavor :  In the 1st third I get a whole lot of leather flavors after getting past some initial spiciness. Almost all I can taste is that bright saddle leather that characterizes many Viajes. In the background I can detect a little soured grass and some cinnamon spice. Flavors transition slightly in this 1st third into leathery, woodsy, and grilled meat flavors.The 2nd third definitely picked up some heft and now the C-4 is more meaty than leathery with flavors of coffee bean in the background. It has hit full bodied in my books at this point. The amount of meat and leather seems to mute out any other secondary or tertiary flavors and I am starting to get the feeling that this stick is pretty one dimensional. The spiciness has been turned up a notch and clings to my tongue and back of my throat.A lot of flavor is lost at the end of the C-4. Simple flavors of wood with hints of leather close out this cigar. It seems that this particular stick was more about power and less about finesse (probably why it\u2019s called the \u201cC-4\u201d). It\u2019s full bodied through most of the stick but it lacks flavor is my mind. Bitter finish.Value :  If you buy a lot of Viajes, then the C-4\u2019s pricetag will not scare you. The $10+ mark is the norm now for Andre\u2019s releases, but I will only give them value if they deliver for the pricetag. This is not the case here.Overall Rating :  The C-4 brings a lot of power and some decent flavors to the table in the first part of the stick, but seems to fold its cards later on in its life.

Iconic Leaf sent me a couple samples last autumn for review along with some promotional material. I wanted to give these cigars some resting time and as our winter hit early, I decided to put off smoking them until the time was right.All of Iconic Leaf's cigars are produced in their factory; Tabacalera Leyendas Cubanas in Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic. They roll all of their cigars entubado style and every leaf in the Recluse is fermented for two years.At first glance the cigar resembles a box-pressed perfecto but to my eyes it actually resembled an Italian made 'Toscano' in a larger, more refined format. Don't snip it in the middle though as you would a Toscano! (*wink*)  Thankfully the company offers instructions on where to snip the cigar in their boxes.  I did not get these with my two review samples and as such I found the draw on the first one quite tight.  I did snip more off the second one and found the draw much improved.The function of a perfecto is that the different components from wrapper to filler allow for the cigar to go through subtle flavor transitions. Iconic Leaf Cigars advises that by developing this one of a kind shape the smoker is able to get a slow, cool burn as a result of the benefit of pressing along with flavor transitions. Iconic Leaf refers to their process as \"specific and unique; a one of a kind process\". Their company literature provides that \"Every cigar has a story to tell. You have to read this book page by page. This one will not allow you to jump chapters. It is a novel.\"Remember I rated their Recluse Toro higher than the Alec Bradley Prensado in flavor so I was more than curious as to how this shape would fare and whether it would alter the flavor profile at all.The promotional material shipped with the cigars indicated that the cigar has \"subtle cornering and is aerodynamic in fashion. It was a painstaking process to perfect this new shape but we have mastered it. The shape smokes razor sharp with a full easy compliment of flavorful smoke on the draw. It is a masterpiece!\".  Let's put this to the test shall we?Appearance :  (4.25) As I already noted, on first glimpse the cigar reminded me of a larger version of a Toscano. The nicely crafted \"pig-tail\" end is meant to be snipped and the company, as stated, offers instructions on where the perfect snip should be. The wrapper had visible veins and some seams. The rustic looking cigar had a nice oily sheen to it though and the visible veins and seams never impacted the burn. The pig-tail was nicely crafted.Construction :  (4.75) The burn was excellent.

The pre-light draw was tight on the first sample, easily remedied by snipping a bit more on my second sample to create a larger opening.The cigar had excellent smoke output for the most part but on both samples was a bit lacking at the start. As expected, the volume increased as it approached the middle (thicker) part of the cigar.  Overall, it needed no relights, the ash was nice and firm with no flaking or other major complaints.Flavor :  I must commend Iconic Leaf for manufacturing an extremely tasty cigar and you really do owe it to yourself to try a cigar from this newcomer to the scene. Fans of Maduro cigars should love this. I actually enjoyed the flavors of the Kan\u00fa more than I did the Toro and wonder if this perhaps was in part attributed to the fact these Kan\u00fa cigars sat in my humidor for 6 months before I smoked them.The cigar starts off quite complex and remains that way. It is perfectly balanced with sweetness, salt, bitterness and spice. It has distinct maduro 'nuttiness' to it and much of the first third was an explosion of flavor going from sweet to creamy, nutty and a very mild hint of orange peel.  The smoke was very velvety offering a nice oily sweet residue on the tongue.The first third revealed flavors of cocoa, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and toasted almond. There was some sweet earthiness on the palate and an occasional hint of orange peel. There was some pleasant saltiness on the lips and the cigar had enough spice to be noticeable and complimentary but not distracting. The finish was long with the sweetness hitting the front of the palate first and more spice lingering in between puffs. Due to its shape there wasn't a lot of thick smoke at the outset but this increases as you reach the thicker part of the cigar.As I approached the halfway mark there were notes of toasted caramel that I likened to the \u2018crispy crackle\u2019 on a creme brul\u00e9. As expected, the cigar's smoke output increased and the smoke took on a sweet cappuccino-like texture. The cigar remained very pleasant, taking on some semi-sweet coffee and cocoa like flavors with hints of dark chocolate.There were still some sweet tones present as I passed the halfway mark but the Kanu morphed into an earthier cigar with notes of toasted almond, sweet wood and leather notes. The spice remained consistent. It was a nice jalape\u00f1o-like heat with a medium finish.By the final third the flavors continued to shine but more occasional bitterness did enter the profile. It wasn\u2019t an unpleasant bitterness but because the majority of the cigar is on the sweeter side, you can really notice the diminished sweetness.  However, the flavors were of dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean and unsweetened espresso and were still enjoyable.  I did get a couple puffs of unpleasant hints of tar and some bitterness that put me off but these were very few and closer to the end of the cigar.  There remained the occasional burst of toasted caramel sweetness with cocoa and spice that made it through in the final third but most of it was definitely more on the \u2018earthier' side.Value :  (4.25) These cigars are still hard to find but the online retailers I've seen carry them have posted prices of between $180-$188 for a box of 20 and singles for approximatelty $10-10.50 staying pretty much consistent with the MSRP.

I always encourage fellow cigar smokers to venture out of the comfort zone and try the new brands and blends.  Admittedly with today\u2019s rising tobacco prices, paying $10.00 for a cigar they never heard of might put some people off but they are worth trying even at this price because in my opinion, they will not leave you feeling ripped off.  It is truly an above average cigar.  It paired well with a cappuccino and would go well with a port or iced tea.Having had both their Toro and now their Kan\u00fa, I am a fan.  Their cigars are becoming easier to find and one can find a retailer near you on their website here.  I look forward to further releases from Iconic Leaf.

To get a chance to win a box of cigars, you can submit yours here.This cigar, in my opinion, has a gorgeous, very dark, wrapper.  The wrapper is slightly toothy with a light oily sheen.  The stick is firm, with no worrisome soft-spots and only a few prominent veins but not concerned about them affecting burn. A quick whiff and I\u2019m met with a strong cedar scent, thanks to the cedar sleeve that covers more than a third of the stick.  Behind that, I get the standard barnyard presence.  Double band, red, that stands out against the nearly black wrapper.  Straight cut, torch lit\u2026I\u2019m not one to identify things such as saddle leather, black currant or green wood.  Seriously, what the hell does leather taste like, and why would someone even know this?  I focus on construction, draw, strength, burn and volume of smoke.  I do appreciate the feel of the smoke in the mouth and make note when pleasing.  Let's see how this cigar plays out.The Pioneer Valley maduro burns like a champ.  The several I\u2019ve smoked produce a nice white ash that is fairly strong requiring no touch-ups, with a straight burn line that, when does get wavy, corrects itself.  This is important to me as this is my fishing cigar and its constantly being bumped and put down, often going extended periods of time without attention.  Draw tends to be on the loose side, maybe too loose for some.  I have to remind myself to slow down as it tends to get hot if drawn to fast/often.  I get a very, very mild nicotine flavor and rate this cigar in the medium category.  This robusto produces a good amount of smoke, but it does not coat the mouth as a more expensive cigar might.  For the price however, I don\u2019t knock too many points off.  I must point out that with the cedar sleeve on, and the age of the sticks in my collection, I do get a nice cedar taste; my horrible palate notwithstanding.The Pioneer Valley Maduro will not blow you away with multiple flavor profiles, nor will it be a stick you reach for on special occasions.  This is a stick however, that I enjoy on a regular basis and bring fishing for a few reasons.  First, it\u2019s not a full bodied cigar which is great for early morning as is often the time I fish. I don\u2019t need to worry about a full stomach before smoking one of these.  Second, I don\u2019t get upset if I have to put it down to handle a fish and it falls overboard, or gets stepped on.  The low-cost of the cigar eases my mind that if it goes to waste I haven\u2019t burned a hole in my wallet.  Lastly, the great burn and short size of the robusto doesn\u2019t force me to commit to a 2-hour smoke.  60 minutes or under affords me both the enjoyment of a cigar and the time to fish.  This cheap smoke, one that I do not hesitate to hand to others, is certainly box-worthy for those of us not concerned about hints of raisins or earth.Thumbs Up!", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/pioneer.jpg?iv=16"}, "san lotano oval robusto": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Rubusto Size : 5.5 x 54 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Habano Filler : Nicaraguan&Honduran Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $8.70More info about purchasing San Lotano Oval cigars...", "overall rating": " (4.25) Complex,\u2026 ummmm,\u2026 not really.

The Oval, being probably the most anticipated release from AJ in his career, was received with grand applause from the cigar reviewers. Now if you read a lot of the articles from this website you will have noticed this cigar never made my list for Top Cigars of 2011. The first couple of samples intrigued me and I liked it a lot but it just didn\u2019t float my boat enough to knock down a spot on my list. But the more and more I smoked of this stick I really got to liking it more and more. So this is my review of the last time I revisited this cigar.Appearance :  (3.75) An unsurprising and simple band wraps this little gem with colors of black and gold.

Aromas of sour shoe leather come to mind when whiffing the stick, and foot smells of simple pipe tobacco.

The only drawback is its quick burn.Flavor :  Woooooweeee!,\u2026 Flavor for days right from the start! Immediate notes of cognac, leather, and beef jerky. Body starts out full from the start and hits with some light pepperiness.1st Third: After the first few puffs the flavor level dials down a little bit and the cognac flavor slightly drops off leaving me a little disappointed. Mocha flavors seem to replace the cognac flavors and the body is more full-minus.2nd Third: No longer is the stick anywhere near full bodied but more a solid medium. The depth of flavor is very good and pleasing,\u2026 not overly complex but very delicious. The cognac flavor seems to weave in and out of every other puff. The smoke has a very balanced and sweet flavor. Some dusty cocoa flavors have seem to join the fray as well near the end. (Cognac is the closest thing I can come up with what I am tasting. Another description may be the flavor that is imparted on scotch by high usage of sherry casks- a syrupy sweet flavor.)3rd Third: Woodsy notes intermingle with the consistent meaty, chocolate, and syrupy sweet flavors now for the conclusion of this cigar. All throughout the flavors were balanced and vivid. A very nice smoke!Value :  (3.75) These aren\u2019t cheap by any means at around $9 for a robusto and $8 for the petit robusto.

My duty free online vendor in Canada sells them for $31.00 per stick (this is Canada however where high tobacco taxes are the norm... and again keep in mind that this was a duty free vendor).  Another local brick and mortar cigar shop in the area sells them for $46.00 per cigar.  I checked some of the well known US online vendors and have found them in the range of $20.95 to $30.95 per cigar.  I did find one vendor that claims to sell them for the MSRP but they are seemingly always out of stock.  In fact, the vendors I did find within 10-15% of the MSRP price were out of stock on the cigar. And that\u2019s the problem.  Because it is in so much demand and because of the limited production of the brand, even when they are in stock, expect most retailers to sell them for a considerable amount over the MSRP price.  People will blindly pay for them simply because they carry the Opus X name.", "reviews": ["I have had a number of Opus X and found them pretty inconsistent.

The ash was often flaky and if you aren\u2019t careful it will fall off on its own.  For such a premium cigar I expected a firmer ash that held on to the cigar longer than the 1 inch or so I was getting.  The burn on my first sample was even until roughly the halfway mark at which point it required correction.  The burn on the second cigar started to go very uneven at roughly the 1/3rd point and it too required multiple corrections. Both cigars needed re-lights past the halfway mark.  Back to the draw.  The first one I smoked was acceptable but a bit open for my liking.  The second cigar was even more open and it required many draws to get acceptable smoke output. As a result, if this cigar is not being puffed frequently it will go out on you.  The cigar did provide thick white clouds of smoke but as I said, I was disappointed in the draw and in the fact that as a result it felt like it needed to be smoked quickly.

The Fuente Fuente Opus X brand has many cigars in their line-up with different blends.  The only thing they share besides the band is the fact that they are all made of Dominican filler, binder and wrapper. Opus X cigars are normally nicknamed by their fans and this particular cigar therefore also goes by the names \u201cPower Ranger\u201d \u201cTriple X\u201d or \u201cX3\u201d.  Whatever you chose to call it, two things will remain common. The difficulty in obtaining them and their price.  Although they carry with them an MSRP of $10.50, most vendors jack up the price when they have them in stock because the demand for them far outstrips supply. On most occasions you will be paying well over $20.00 for them (more in the \u201cvalue\u201d section of the review).The Fuente Fuente Opus XXX cigar is perhaps the most popular high end non-Cuban cigar in the world.  One would expect that a cigar that carries with it a hefty price tag would smoke like a dream.  One would expect magnificent complexity and flawless construction.  You would also expect that a cigar with as much \u201chype\u201d built around the name will leave you wanting more.  These cigars have become one of the most sought after cigars, akin to the Cuban Cohiba line.  With all that said, I want to share with you my experience of how this cigar measures up in terms of the 4 points we cigar smokers like to take note of when smoking a cigar.  Remember that in life beauty is only skin deep. The same holds true in the cigar world. Does this cigar measure up to the looks and the hype?  For the purpose of this review I smoked two cigars a week apart to ensure objectivity.Appearance :  This is truly a gorgeous looking cigar. It is adorned with the beautiful and large Opus X band, perhaps one of the most elaborate and recognizable bands on the cigar market.  It also sports a red ribbon around the foot of the cigar, presumably to offer additional protection to the foot of this cellophane packaged cigar.  The wrapper was beautiful, had no visible seams and had a very visually pleasing oily texture to the shade grown Dominican Rosado wrapper.  The cigar looked and felt like a meticulously constructed high end cigar. There were no soft spots on inspection and this Belicoso truly had a flawless presentation.The unlit aroma had mild but very discernable floral bouquet with hints of dried fruit vanilla and natural tobacco.  The pre-light draw was floral and provided pleasing sweetness notes.Construction :  (2.75) Although the cigar looked absolutely striking, I found the draw to be a tad loose. The ash was often flaky and if you aren\u2019t careful it will fall off on its own.  For such a premium cigar I expected a firmer ash that held on to the cigar longer than the 1 inch or so I was getting.  The burn on my first sample was even until roughly the halfway mark at which point it required correction.  The burn on the second cigar started to go very uneven at roughly the 1/3rd point and it too required multiple corrections. Both cigars needed re-lights past the halfway mark.  Back to the draw.  The first one I smoked was acceptable but a bit open for my liking.  The second cigar was even more open and it required many draws to get acceptable smoke output. As a result, if this cigar is not being puffed frequently it will go out on you.  The cigar did provide thick white clouds of smoke but as I said, I was disappointed in the draw and in the fact that as a result it felt like it needed to be smoked quickly. I again go back to the price and that flaws like this should not be observed on cigars considered to be \u201cpremium\u201d.Flavor :  (2.25) This is where I may get some flack from Opus X fans.  However, I feel that in order to provide an objective review I can\u2019t let the price tag or popularity of a cigar get in the way.  Keep in mind though that taste, flavour, and aromas are all subjective.  We have different palates and we all have preferred cigar flavour profiles.  I understand that.  Some people like sweet cigars while some others like more earthy spicy smokes.  I prefer all flavors because sticking to just one flavour profile will inevitably make your cigar smoking time less enjoyable.  Despite all of our different preferences, cigar smokers can usually agree on one thing; whether or not the cigar they smoked resulted in a pleasurable experience.  My intent here is not to trash the cigar.  My review will not impact Opus X sales and won\u2019t keep an Opus X fan from ever buying more.  I am simply passing on my own observations about this cigar.Be prepared with a nice cool beverage when smoking this cigar.  I often felt my mouth drying up on me and leaving me with a \u201ccotton mouth\u201d sensation.  Also, ensure that you have had something to eat, preferably a nice hearty meal.  This cigar is not for novices.  As a cigar smoker of over 20 years myself, I was hit with quite the nicotine \u201cbuzz\u201d on both samples along with some slight sweats and blushing cheeks.I was hit immediately with spice on lighting the cigar.  It wasn\u2019t a \u2018peppery\u2019 spice but more of a cayenne, red pepper type spice that hit me both on the front and back end of the palate. It was like sucking on a habanaro chili pepper.   I usually like to exhale from the nose and this is something I recommend you not to do with this cigar unless you absolutely love spice.  The intensity of the spice literally made my eyes water.  I likened it to taking a mouthful of Japanese wasabi.  You know that type of heat that overwhelms your sinuses and makes your eyes tear up?  As a result, any flavors that the cigar might have been trying to offer me were completely masked by the overwhelming spice.  I don\u2019t remember ever having a cigar with such a spicy heat to it.The spicy finish was extremely long. The spicy sensation never left my palate or lips for the entire first third of the cigar. I was craving a lemon sorbet to sooth and calm my palate. For the first third of the cigar I could not discern any flavour other than natural tobacco flavour and this was strictly due to the amount of heat the cigar was giving me.The spice finally decreased as I neared completion of the fist third at which point I started to pick up some hints of toasted nuts, vanilla and a honey like sweetness.  The smoke was extremely thick and when not being overpowered by the spice I was able to get a nice velvety smoke with hints of vanilla and coffee in my mouth.  The spice remained in the back end of my palate.  There were some minor hints of dried fruit but the predominant flavors were woodsy and earthy which became more pronounced as I smoked my way through the cigar. The heat came and went during the second third of the cigar but thankfully it was nowhere near the intensity of the first third.  A pleasant saltiness made its way into the flavour profile and remained on my lips for the rest of the smoke. I never thought I would say this about a cigar but, at times, the cigar was a bit too salty on my lips.As I started to reach the end of the second third of the cigar I noticed that the spice was increasing in intensity again.  This time the front part of the palate was getting more white pepper hints but the back of my throat and the long finish was again more like red pepper spice.  At this point I mainly tasted woodsy flavors with natural tobacco and earthiness in the mix.  I was only getting occasional hints of coffee, vanilla and roasted nuts. The saltiness and spice remained on my lips.The final third had some more detectable sweetness to the smoke. The clouds of smoke were leaving a pleasing honey-like residue in my mouth however it was hard to get the same volume of smoke output as the fist half of the cigar because of the loose draw.  As I noted earlier, both samples needed to be re-lit at this point.  The second sample more than the first.The large band came off with ease and the final third saw the intensity of the spice reach epic proportions again.  By this time I was buzzing with the strength of this cigar. Again, whatever flavors the cigar was trying to offer up were masked by the overwhelming spice.  The spice was so hard hitting that long after I finished the cigar I could still feel some chili-like heat tingling on my lips.This cigar is strong. You start to feel the nicotine by the end of the first third and by the end you are certainly left buzzing. This is unquestionably a \u2018mature\u2019 cigar for \u2018mature smokers\u2019. As I noted at the outset, even I, a cigar smoker of 20 some odd years was hit by the nicotine buzz.When all was said and done the cigar disappointed.  On the odd occasion when I was able to cut through all that spice I did pick up some pleasing flavors noted above. I tried to think of the best way to explain the experience and came up with likening it to ordering an expensive entr\u00e9e at a fine restaurant that smelled and looked fantastic when it reached the table.  The odd bite was absolutely amazing but the chef simply incorporated too much spice into the dish that it ruined the meal, not allowing any of the flavors of the dish to shine and masking any complexity that might have existed.Don\u2019t get me wrong. I like peppery flavors in my cigars.  However I found the spice in this cigar simply too much. Unlike sushi where the wasabi compliments the sashimi, this felt like I was first taking a spoonful of wasabi and then nibbling on the sushi. The spice did not compliment the cigar, ruining it instead.Value :  These cigars carry with them an MSRP of $10.50 however. because of the popularity of the brand, you can realistically expect to pay upwards of $30.00 for a single stick in the United States. I did a little price shopping online for the purpose of this review.  My duty free online vendor in Canada sells them for $31.00 per stick (this is Canada however where high tobacco taxes are the norm... and again keep in mind that this was a duty free vendor).  Another local brick and mortar cigar shop in the area sells them for $46.00 per cigar.  I checked some of the well known US online vendors and have found them in the range of $20.95 to $30.95 per cigar.  I did find one vendor that claims to sell them for the MSRP but they are seemingly always out of stock.  In fact, the vendors I did find within 10-15% of the MSRP price were out of stock on the cigar. And that\u2019s the problem.  Because it is in so much demand and because of the limited production of the brand, even when they are in stock, expect most retailers to sell them for a considerable amount over the MSRP price.  People will blindly pay for them simply because they carry the Opus X name.I paid $17.00 each for mine while visiting Florida 2 years ago.  I can\u2019t consider this a $10.50 cigar because the reality is, anywhere that I found that actually had them in stock was charging considerably more, at minimum, 100% over the suggested retail price. Considering the high cost of this cigar then, the cigar clearly disappointed me. One would expect a much better, complex cigar for that price tag. I can buy 2 or 3 better tasting cigars for the price you can expect to realistically pay for one of these.Overall Rating :  As I noted, cigar tasting experiences are subjective.  We all have different palates and we all crave different flavors in our cigars.  However, regardless of our preferences, we can always agree on whether or not a cigar was enjoyable. Unfortunately for me, I did not have an enjoyable experience with these cigars.  I was left with a headache because of the extreme power of these cigars.  I was also left with heartburn thanks to the overwhelming spice that dominated most of the smoking experience.  It wasn\u2019t all horrible.  There were promising hints of vanilla, coffee, dried fruit combined with a pleasant woodsy earthiness that were trying to fight there way through but they were always seemingly held back by the abundant spice.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t buy any more of these.  That is how bad the impression was on me. The smoke output and its texture and flavors were good at the start but diminished as I smoked my way through the cigar.  Regrettably the two words that best sum up my experience with this cigar are \u2018overpriced\u2019 and \u2018overhyped\u2019. If you are really hell bent on hunting down Opus X Cigars, in terms of flavour, I preferred the Opus X Magnum O and would recommend the Magnum O over the XXX Belicoso.I have had a number of Opus X and found them pretty inconsistent.  I have had a few that have been incredible.  A great Belicoso that was particularly memorable.  Most though are pretty boring and not a very nice flavor. Usually harsh.  Construction  is the same.  The good ones have a great ash and burn but the others were flakey.  I find that 90% of NC have flimsy, flakey ashes and a very loose draw.The Anejo is so popular as well.  I have tried most if not all and had ONE good one (not great).I am still pretty new to cigars but most of the NC have been so unimpressive.  The main exception has been Oliva V and Masters Blend which are amazing and very consistent.", "flavor": " (2.25) This is where I may get some flack from Opus X fans.

It\u2019s understandable in today\u2019s time-crunched society that a longer length cigar with a tiny ring gauge, which forces you to take more deliberately slow draws to avoid excess heat, holds relatively less interest from a purely practical standpoint. Perhaps a cigar with an origin in Hollywood can persuade smokers that they\u2019ve been missing something.The Fuente family is known for their marketing prowess, and the Lost City line of cigars is no exception. Director Andy Garcia needed several scenes for his movie \u201cThe Lost City\u201d shot on a tobacco farm, which wouldn\u2019t normally be difficult if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that the growing season was over. Carlito Fuente was happy to provide a location for shooting the film by planting tobacco leaf off-season. He later used this leaf for his Lost City branded cigars. It is interesting to note; however, that the lancero is one of a few vitolas that does not actually utilize this unique tobacco leaf in its blend. Despite this fact, the small ring gauge lends a distinct flavor to the Opus X line that nothing else does.The toothy Rosado wrapper has only a few very small, almost unnoticeable veins with an even coloring throughout. As with all of the Opus X cigars, the firm bunch does not create draw problems and facilitates a nice slow burn. This is a masterfully rolled, blemish free cigar that only becomes more aesthetically pleasing through the artful design and execution of the bands.Leather, driftwood, and pepper are the dominant flavors at the beginning of the cigar. A subtle sweetness gently blends its way into the combination of flavors and begins to overtake the note of wood. In the last third the cigar hints at a pleasant nutty flavor before becoming bitter at the final inch.This handsome lancero does not rank among the most complex cigars I\u2019ve smoked; however, the flavor is pleasing and unique. Take a few hours from your day, sit in a comfortable chair with your favorite Scotch, and take the time to really savor the Fuente Fuente Opus X Lost City Lancero.

This new line is billed as being medium-bodied/medium strength in comparison to the full-bodied, powerful Illusione. Apparently to tone down the blend Dion chose to use the viso leaf instead of using ligero. Viso is the priming right below ligero on the tobacco plant.  The Cruzado is made at the same factory as the Illusione, at the Raices Cubanas factory in Honduras.They are available is six sizes:One thing about this line that immediately jumps out at me is the ring gauges.  Not a single one of these cigars breaks 48 in ring size, not even the perfecto.  I applaud this.  In an age where big, fat, jaw breaker cigars with 50+ ring gauges seem to be all anyone wants to make, I am happy to see a line of cigars made in more traditional sizes.  I happen to think that cigars in the 42 to 48 range of ring sizes is ideal, allowing for an optimal marriage between the filler blend and the wrapper leaf.  I am very excited to see the smaller ring gauges in this line of cigars and I look forward to trying all of them.First up is the Elitas.  A 6\u2033 x 44 corona, this seemed like the perfect place to start.  After all, you can\u2019t get more traditional than the Corona.  I am going to use a word, probably more than once, that I am beginning to feel I over use a bit, but it is the best word I can come up with in those situations that I use it.  Rustic.  The Criollo wrapper on the Cruzado is very rustic looking.  It is rumpled looking, dark, and bumpy.  It has a strange little pigtail on the head.  It almost looks like a half-pigtail.  Like they started to give it a pigtail cap and then just decided, \u201cnah, never mind\u201d and clipped it off leaving just little stub of the tail behind.  The band has a medieval look too it.  The silver looks more like steel and it is trimmed in gold that looks more like riveted brass.  The font used to spell out Cruzado looks like it was lifted off of a knight's coat of arms.  All told it is a cool looking stick.  I feel like I should be wearing some shades to be cool enough to smoke it, ha ha.My initial draw delivers a blast of pepper and spice.  This is supposedly a medium bodied cigar which makes me chuckle because this cigar has the volume turned up to 10, full bodied at least at the start.  As I worked my way into the smoke it does settle down a bit but this is still a full bodied smoke and it packs a nice little punch in the strength department as well.  The flavors are spicy with a slightly sweet finish, full of earth and leather.  There are flashes of chocolate and something else I can\u2019t identify.  Maybe a slight tinge of citrus.  What a complex flavor bomb.  Not even half way through the cigar and I am blown away by this smoke.  Chocolate, spice, earth, and a sweetness I cannot place keep swirling in and out with each puff all capped off with a long satisfying, citrusy finish.  I have never smoked a cigar like this.  It is truly unique.  This is as good as any super premium cigar I\u2019ve tried.  Thick clouds of smoke billow out with each draw and the aroma is rich and decadent.  The burn and draw were perfect.  The only negative thing I can say about this stick is that the ash splits and curls off.  Tapping it frequently is a must to keep the ash out of your lap.From start to finish this is an amazing smoke.  This is nothing like an Illusione which is an outstanding cigar in its own right.  Dion has come up with a completely different cigar with the Cruzado and it is a spectacular cigar.  The Cruzado was billed as a medium bodied cigar, flavorful but a little less robust than the Illusione.  If you ask me this is as full and strong as an Illusione if not more so.  This may be the best cigar of 2008 and is possibly the best cigar to come out since the Tatuaje Brown Labels hit the scene.  It is a MUST try.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Again, as with Devil\u2019s Weed, it is really cool to see cigar lines utilizing history as a means to add another dimension to the branding. This Crusaders cross adorned the Latin Kingdon in Jerusalem and was meant to signify the four gospels being brought to the four corners of the earth.

It sports a new band (you can see the old band in Jerry\u2019s review) but it seems like the blend hasn\u2019t changed and the moving was caused by Padilla\u2019s desire to reduce costs by controlling the production (Don Pepin Garcia, the previous blender, being quite busy with other cigars might have also played its role). I haven\u2019t tried the old blend so I will not be able to compare the two \u2013 consider it as a regular review.Appearance :  That\u2019s another gorgeous cigar.

Leather, spice and nuts are the flavors that I expected but upon lighting the cigar developed a strong earthy taste. The smoke is medium-bodied and leaves a sweet aftertaste. Very soon, it starts showing signs of buttery and nutty flavors, barely perceptible. I am surprised at the lack of peppery notes but in the second third the Padilla Miami picks up some serious spice which will be present until the very end, more and more powerful.

He is a smoker, but not of tobacco products, so I wanted to give him something with a good flavor, but that wouldn't have him running to the bathroom. Enter the Por Larranaga Cuban Grade. A while ago I discovered this cigar as a cheap, favorable, mild cigar that is perfect with coffee, or to pass out to non-smokers.The consensus from reviewers is that the Cuban Grade feels spongy, which I have found to be true regardless of storage conditions. The burn quality is consistently razor sharp on all of the Cuban Grades I have smoked. The cigar does smoke quickly, clocking in at 30 to 45 minutes.These sticks are not packed with flavor, so do not try smoking them with a full flavor beer like a porter or stout. I prefer them with my morning coffee, although the ones we smoked a the wedding paired nicely with cheap American beer. The profile consists of a solid but mild woody base. An occasional kiss of nuts or chocolate can be found, but not on every cigar. The flavor definitely comes from the San Andreas Maduro wrapper, as the Connecticut broadleaf wrapped version of the Cuban Grade has a taste akin to an unfiltered Camel cigarette.It is not very often that I get a chance to smoke a cigar with my coffee, but when I do, the Por Larranaga Cuban Grade is usually the one I reach for. Rumor has it that this cigar has been discontinued, and the Altadis USA website did not have a listing for it in the company's product lineup. There are still plenty of places online to find the Cuban Grade, but when my current supply runs out I will most likely look for an alternate coffee accompaniment.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/por-larranaga-cuban-grade.jpg?iv=16"}, "oliva serie v maduro especial 2011": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Toro Size : 6 x 50 Wrapper : Mexican San Andres maduro Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : ~$10 eachMore info about purchasing Oliva Serie V Maduro cigars...", "overall rating": " The Oliva Serie V Maduro Especial 2011 is a solid offering in the Oliva cigar line, correcting tight draw problems that the line suffered from in the past.

The first third is dominated by earthy dark chocolate notes and bitter coffee.  You can pick up some black pepper on the retrohale, but it stays in the backdrop.  During the second half, the flavor profile morphs, and the quantity of smoke increases.  The earthy and chocolaty notes take a back seat, and are replaced by cedar and nuts.  The coffee notes become stronger, and the draw opens up a bit more (which is a good thing; it was still a little tight in the beginning).

Well when Jorge speaks about cigars, I listen and I went straight to my premium brick & mortar tobacconist and ordered them. The 35 is not only the latest from Matasa, but a rather unique offering from them as well. It commemorates the 35th anniversary of Matasa and was actually created by the fifth-generation of the Quesada family to be in the cigar business, who family patriarch Manolo Quesada calls, \u201cthe young ones\u201d. It is also their first, I believe, to bear the family name.The Quesada 35 is made with an Equadorian arapiraca wrapper; a Cuban seed, criollo-98 binder from their 2008 crop grown in the Dominican Republic; and an interesting filler consisting of one leaf of the aforementioned 2008 crop blended with Havana Vuelta arriba ligeros from the Navarrete region of the Dominican Republic, and some ligeros from the Esteli region of Nicaragua. It is being released in a 6 x 49 box pressed Toro vitolla in a limited edition of only 1000 boxes with 20 cigars each.The first thing I noticed was the attractive triple banding, which was black, silver, and gold, and complimented the wrapper perfectly. The wrapper itself was a beautiful oily, maduro color with no noticeable flaws. The body was smooth, very firm (indicating a well packed cigar), and had no indentations or soft spots. The pre-light aroma was distinctly smooth and sweet and was more pronounced at the foot. I made a straight cut with scissors and tested the draw, which was smooth with a nice, moderate resistance (another indication of being well packed), which also revealed a pleasant \u2018woody\u2019 taste on the lips.After lighting, the Quesada 35 presented a remarkably smooth start and as it began to warm developed an exceptionally smooth draw. It produced copious amounts of light grey smoke and left a similar colored, soft ash with dark highlights. At about \u00bc inch in it began to develop a slight spicy tingle on the tip of the tongue along with what were perhaps mild coffee notes. Retro-exhalation was relatively smooth with a spicy sensation all the way at the back of the sinuses and at about 1\u00bd inches in it began to present notes of slightly bitter chocolate or unsweetened cocoa. In the middle-third the spice began to pick up subtly and could be felt around and even under the tongue. In the final-third the spice began to mellow but remained at the tip of the tongue and the unsweetened cocoa flavor intensified.The Quesada 35th Anniversary is definitely a very good cigar. It is medium to full in body with balance and some complexity. The only thing I didn\u2019t like was that I had a heck of a time keeping it lit and actually used up my lighter by the time I reached the end. Of course this doesn\u2019t take away from all the fine qualities I mentioned above, but this sort of thing can be a distraction when trying to enjoy a cigar. Keep in mind that this certainly could have been an individual fluke, others have said theirs burned flawlessly. Give it a try and enjoy it for yourself.\u201cSmoking is an enchanting experience that can instantly bring you back to a favorite moment or a fond memory. It is something that only those who love cigars can appreciate and understand.\u201d - Patricia Quesada, one of \u201cthe young ones\u201d", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/quesada.jpg?iv=16"}, "alec bradley american classic": {"origin": "Origin : Honduras Format : Toro Size : 6 x 50 Wrapper : Honduran Connecticut Shade Filler : Honduras, Nicaragua Binder : Honduras, Nicaragua Hand-Made Price : $5 MSRP (street price should be considerably less)More info about purchasing Alec Bradley American Classic cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "alec bradley", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["These notes caught me off guard the first time, but I loved it!

These choice sticks sometimes become a Joe\u2019s Gem while other times simply an incentive to purchase a box.  Right now I am giddy over a sample of the soon-to-be-released Alec Bradley American Classic Blend.The term \u201cAmerican Classic Blend\u201d is one many cigar makers have used and generally means the cigar has a Conn. Shade wrapper.  But these days, some of the best tasting Conn. Shade wrappers are grown outside the US.  Such is the case with the new ABC (Alec Bradley Cigars) release.  It sports a Honduran grown wrapper from Conn. Shade seed\u2026and it\u2019s gorgeous.  With a golden brown hue and leathery feel, this cigar looks like a winner.  But its good looks are only the beginning of a wonderful smoking adventure\u2026Upon ignition it soon becomes clear that this is really a classic cigar.  Not because its name says so, but rather by its perfect construction and wonderful flavor.  Conn. Wrapper can sometimes foreshadow a cigar too mild for an experienced smoker to enjoy.  In the case of the ABC-ACB (whah!), the smoker is rewarded by a complexity and taste evolution worthy of a sun-grown wrapper.  What starts out light and smooth gradually becomes darker in flavor with a highly complex almost bitter undertone.  This bitterness is not off-putting but rather serves to add an interesting flavor component of dark chocolate and espresso.  What?!  Chocolate and espresso in a Conn. Shade cigar?!  That alone makes this stick unique.  But with a binder-filler mix of Jalapa, Esteli, and Condega tobaccos, the source of this complexity and flavor is not a mystery.  These regions of Honduras and Nicaragua are well known for their strong and flavorful tobaccos.As we continue to smoke, the flavor gets more intense as does its strength.  This cigar is billed as a mild-medium strength stick but if you smoke it as a first cigar in the day, it can seem quite strong.  As we progress to its nub, the ABC-ACB gives a pretty good kick.  And BTW, this cigar burns dead-on with an ash that is hard to shake off.  This is one of the best-constructed cigars I\u2019ve ever smoked.As you can see, I really love this stick.  But the best part of this cigar is also the least expected.  If I were to guess its MSRP I would have said something north of $10.  I\u2019ve paid that much for cigars with half the character of the ABC-ACB.  But to my surprise and delight, the toro I smoked had an MSRP of $5\u2026 FIVE DOLLARS!  That is an astounding price for a cigar of such character.  This just goes to show that indeed, cigar price has nothing whatsoever to do with quality.  It will be interesting to see what the street price is for this cigar line and, if these cigars follow the usual pricing structures, boxes of these should go pretty cheap.With the creation of the American Classic Blend, Alec Bradley has raised the bar not only for value-priced cigars but for Conn. Shade cigars in general.  The flavor and construction of this cigar is worthy of a price much higher than its MSRP and hopefully, other cigar makers will take notice.  Today\u2019s cigar smokers are smarter than ever and we understand that value should not mean a compromise in quality. Now there is no looking back, the genie is out of the bottle, and a new standard for inexpensive cigars has been set.

The Flor de las Antillas is a hand rolled Nicaraguan puro that is being made to honor the Garcia families ties to Cuba. In 2012, this cigar earned the first spot on Cigar Aficionado's \"Cigars of the Year\" list. The Flor de las Antillas are available in boxes of 20 and come in the following four sizes:On to the review\u2026Upon visual inspection my Flor de las Antillas Belicoso bore a nice oily brown wrapper however lots of thick veins were present.  Point on the cap was very well constructed and the cigar had a semi-box press to it.  Foot of the cigar had a red ribbon placed around it and the band was very detailed and colorful.  Pre-light smell was not easily defined but I was able to pick up notes of chocolate and slight barnyard.  Cold draw was tight with no true defining tastes except a bit of spice on the lips.The Flor de las Antillas opened in the medium full range with a rich tobacco and coca tastes that left a reminiscence of spice on the tongue.  Ash was a very white tower and the burn a bit wavy.  Aroma was a wonderful old musty, aged scent and I must say the entire first third was not overly complex but very enjoyable!The second third of the cigar had to be immediately touched up as the burn became too jagged.  The chocolate tastes had certainly detailed themselves and the cigar was still in the medium-full range.  A hint of dry wood crept into the taste profile near the end of the second third and the aroma remained wonderfully intoxicating.The final third of my Flor de las Antillas was by far the least enjoyable part of this smoking experience.  Tastes in the final third were a little harsh and detailed a spicy, flinty, burnt character.  This could be summed up as the cigar needing more sitting (aging) due to young tobacco.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the cigar wasn\u2019t terrible, it just didn\u2019t finish as strong as it started.  Burn remained wavy until the end and the aroma great throughout.To sum it up I would say this is another great cigar from Pepin Garcia and My Father Cigars.  I do suggest you try the Flor de las Antillas as I am looking forward to trying other vitolas in the brand.  I certainly will be purchasing some more of the belicoso style to put down.  Hopefully I can calm that final third to match the rest of the smoking experience.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 7 pts. Overall Experience: 8 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

I previously reviewed the Cruzado Elitas which I found to be an amazing smoke.  In that review I laid out all the details of the Cruzado line so rather than repeat all that in this review, just click here if you're interested in those details.  Today I am smoking the Marelas.  The Marelas is a perfecto and a skinny one at that.  I mentioned before one of the things about the Cruzados is that not a single stick in the entire line tops a 48 ring size and that includes this perfecto, which at its thickest is just a 46 ring.  I am partial to the thinner ring gauges.  In my opinion the 42-48 range for ring size is an ideal size for a cigar allowing for the best balance of flavors between wrapper and blend.After having such a great experience with the Elitas I smoked a few more of them and each was equally impressive, so when I lit the Marelas I was a little surprised.  Two things account for this.  The first was an initial blast of metallic bitterness on the first few puffs.  The second was that this cigar seems a bit milder in strength and body.  Thankfully the metallic taste went away quickly.  It was replaced by earth and leather.  The aroma is rich and earthy as well.  It has a delicious sweet finish.  Once I worked past the bulge near the foot, the flavors became rich and creamy, full of sweet spice and a hint of pepper.  This was the best that it would get though.  Unfortunately it became a bit bitter again.   The bitterness kept coming and going in between pleasant notes of earth and leather and this continued all the way until the end of the smoke.  I\u2019m not sure what happened here.  Although the size and shape of a cigar can effect the flavors of a blend, I was expecting this to be at least similar to the Elitas but it was not.  It showed promise when the bitterness was absent, but because of it I didn\u2019t enjoy this vitola nearly as much as the Elitas.  My hope is this was a fluke, and I\u2019ll give the Marelas another try.  If my experience is any different I\u2019ll report back on it.My first experience with the Marelas was a little disappointing.  However, I decided to hold off giving the cigar a rating and planned to revisit it because I could see a lot of potential in it, plus all the other vitolas I have tried in the Cruzado line have been stellar, especially the Elitas.  The first specimen I tried had an odd bitterness to it that tainted my experience.  This time things were much different.Right from the start this cigar was smooth and yet powerful, much more like the other Cruzados I have smoked. It started off with notes of spice and fruit.  As I worked past the bulge of the perfecto it really started to pickup.  Strong robust flavors of coffee and spice mingle with a rich tobacco flavors.  It still wasn\u2019t the power house I found the Elitas to be, but it was much fuller this time, its body on the full side of medium.  As the cigar tapers down it gets spicier and with lots of chocolate and coffee.  it never gets harsh though remaining smooth with a creamy finish that lingers nicely on the palette.  This is more like what I was expecting the first time I smoked this cigar.  An excellent smoke that I highly recommend.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.My Review of the Cruzado MarelasOne thing I like about the line already is that not one single size exceeds a 48 ring gauge except the perfecto. This will ensure that the wrapper\u2019s flavor is more in the forefront than in many other blends.The cigar\u2019s band seems to reflect a \u201cknight\u2019s theme\u201d: gold, silver and black seem to give the impression you need some armor to smoke this cigar.The wrapper is thin and oily, with a reddish hue somewhere between maduro and Colorado maduro. The perfecto cuts well and the pre-light draw, to quote our buddy Larry, is like sucking through a big straw.The cigar takes a light easy and I am enveloped in a plume of rich earthy smoke.What strikes me in the first puff as I blow it through my nose: this is not a medium bodied or medium strength cigar! This is a flavor firecracker! The felling I get through my nose as I blow the smoke out is the same I get with a LG Diez.Right away the cigar is both sweet and spicy, loads of chocolate and spiced apple (that\u2019s right \u2013 apple) compete for attention in my mouth. There are also hints of cedar and coffee present.As I get to the \u201cbulb\u201d of perfecto, the cigar gets spicier and makes me wonder if this is fuller in flavor and strength than the Illusione\u2026As the cigar narrows the flavors get sweeter and richer, I pick up more cocoa and coffee with every puff with just a hint of anise on the finish. My only complaint is on the finish, which is really short.

To me, the Illusione is earthy and rustic, while the Cruzado is crisp and refined.This has been one of the best new cigars I have tried since the debut of the original Tatuaje blend.

Tatuaje Reserva SW is a big stick with an oily, leathery, brown wrapper. There were small veins throughout and it was a little bumpy giving it a slightly rustic look. It had an expertly applied triple cap that clipped perfectly. It was well filled with no sign of any rib veins in the filler at the head or foot. The pre-light draw was firm with just the right amount of resistance. Very peppery at the start, it mellowed quickly to a nice woody core and vanilla notes with a nice earthy finish. I\u2019d describe it as medium to full bodied, not as robust as the Regio or Noella. Half way through the vanilla disappeared and it got buttery/creamy with cocoa notes. The last third was the smoothest dominated by wood and leather. A fantastic and complex smoke from start to finish. If it wasn\u2019t for the price I could smoke this every day.The burn was nice and even. The only thing I can say bad about this cigar is the ash. It was flaky and didn\u2019t hold as well as I have come accustomed to with other Tatuajes.In the above review I didn\u2019t give it the full attention to detail it deserved so I decided it was time to revisit this stellar cigar here on the blog.The Tatuaje Reserva SW is part of the Selecci\u00f3n de Cazador line of Tatuajes, which is also commonly referred to as the Brown Label or Tatuaje Cabinet, and even sometimes as Tatuaje Miami. The Reserva extension of this line is a collection of super premium cigars. It is available in three vitolas. The robusto sized 5\u00d750 Reserva J21, the \u201cA\u201d sized 9.25\u00d747 Reserva A Uno, and the Churchill sized 7\u00d747 Reserva SW. The SW is a not so subtle reference to Sir Winston Churchill who was particularly fond of the vitola that now bears his name. Of course like all Tatuajes, the SW is made in the traditional Cuban style with a triple cap by the master blender and cigar maker Don Pepin Garcia. The Reserva takes it\u2019s Cubanesque styling a step further with the \u201cReserva\u201d name and the black and gold Reserva band that very closely resembles the \u201cReserva\u201d band used by some Cuban brands\u2019 super premium line extensions. Pete Johnson is a huge fan of Cuban cigars and the Cuban cigar industry so a lot of what Tatuaje does is fashioned after the Cuban brands. The Reserva Line of Tatuajes tend to be a milder blend then the rest of the Brown label line but I find that they tend to be a bit more complex as a result.Before getting down to business, I took a moment to admire the leathery brown wrapper. It had a slight oily sheen and a few thin but prominent veins running across it, giving it a slightly rustic look. The triple cap on the head clipped perfectly with my trusty Palio. A pre-light puff reveals a perfect draw and delivers a hint of black pepper to the toungue. I used my brand new ST Dupont X-tend lighter to put the cigar to flame. The Reserva SW starts off like most Tatuajes with Pepin Garcia\u2019s trademark peppery start. It only takes a few good draws for this one to settle down. Noticeably mellower than the standard Brown Label Tats, for most of the 1st half it is a very smooth and creamy smoke. It has a very woody core with undertones of coffee and cream. The creaminess of the smoke has an almost buttery feel to it. The smoke is thick and slow to dissipate. Once you pass the halfway mark, the cigar begins to pick up a bit. It gets a bit more robust but never threatens to become what you\u2019d call full bodied. The flavors got more earthy and leathery, less creamy, and the finish seemed to hang on longer but it never lost its smoothness. As I tried to nub it down to my fingers there was a return of the black pepper I experienced at the start of the smoke. It was there for about the last smokable inch of the cigar and may be attributable to tar buildup near the head. Construction was impeccable and the burn perfect. The ash was firm but a bit papery on the edges.The Reserva SW is far and away my favorite Churchill and when pushed to name a number one overall favorite cigar, this one still manages to grab that title for me. With only one anomalous exception among the many I\u2019ve smoked, I have never been anything short of wowed by this cigar. It is 2 hours of pure smoking pleasure. It\u2019s smoothness couple with its impressive complexity suits my palate to a \u201cT\u201d.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

This brand is owned by Ashton and I found a pretty good description on their website:San Cristobal Seleccion Del Sol is the finest new cigar of 2009.  Handcrafted by the Garcia family, these cigars feature a very special sun-grown wrapper grown on the family's \"Estrella\" farm in Esteli, Nicaragua.

The wrapper and filler tobaccos smell strongly of black tea leaves. Construction is perfect with no soft spots, good amount of filling, and razor sharp burn that needs no touch-ups.1st Third- Filler tobaccos start off with slightly bitter but floral qualities.

There were a few spots where the wrapper would come off a little, which caused some problems during smoking.Construction :  Good things first - the burn was always perfect. I've smoked about 5 Anniversario No. 2-s and only like two of those had a fine draw. On the other ones, it was either too easy or too tight. On one stick, the wrapper completely unraveled. I'm pretty surprised about the results I had since I have heard a lot of positive reviews on Davidoff cigars... \u00a0 Flavor :  The flavor is really single-dimensional. In the very beginning, I got a very mild and smooth mix of cocoa, nutty and leathery flavors. The smoke is creamy and quite enjoyable. The problem that in the last third, exactly the same flavors were there. No change at all and this is to avoid with a churchill.Value :  Not the best investment out there. For this money, better go get yourself a Griffin's or an Ashton. If you received some as a gift though, they can be nice.Overall Rating :  Disappointing. If you're after a high quality churchill, the Davidoff Anniversario No. 2 is not what you're looking for. If you have a chance to get some Cuban cigars, go for a Cohiba Esplendidos or a H. Upmann Sir Winston. Otherwise, try an Ashton Prime Minister.", "flavor": " The flavor is really single-dimensional.

They arrived as we were headed into winter so they have been in my humidor resting since November of last year.  I want to thank them for sending me 3 samples to review.  It\u2019s always nice when I can smoke more than one so that I can ensure that I just didn\u2019t catch a bad day or a bad cigar. It also helps in getting a feel for consistency.The cigars are blended by brothers Azarias Mustafa C\u00f3rdoba and Osniel Mustafa C\u00f3rdoba from Pinar Del Rio Cuba whose family has been growing tobacco for generations.  The name of the company takes on the last names of their grandmother Celestina Cordoba Morales from which the brothers learned much of what they know.  They now manufacture their cigars in Estel\u00ed, Nicaragua using fillers from three different regions in Nicaragua... Estel\u00ed, Condega and Jalapa.  Their binder is from Estel\u00ed and they use Ecuadorian habano wrapper for their  Family Reserve.Appearance :  (4.75) The Cordoba & Morales looks really inviting. A nice oily sheen, some noticeable veins and tightly packed but visible seams.  The band looks elegant, not over the top but very nice.

Pre-light draw appeared a bit too loose for me, offering no resistance and I thought it would present a problem on smoking.  However, I was pleasantly relieved that none of these issues presented a problem on smoking.  I was actually quite pleased with how the cigar smoked.  It burned well, averaging an hour and 15 minutes.The cigar held up well to the guillotine cut and the burn of the cigar was exceptional on all 3 samples.  Only one of them needed a re-light but admittedly it was my fault for keeping it down too long while I got caught up making my notes.The cigar's draw was a tad open with minimal to no resistance but like I said, presented no real problems.  It burned at a nice rate with the burn remaining even throughout.A concern was noted on one sample when I was able to grab a stem tip that was in the cigar and pulled it out with a leaf of approximately 2cm long.  This does happen now and then but still warranted a deduction.  The cigar was just a tad spongy to the touch and was a bit loosely packed.The grey ash held up nice and firm on two of the 3 samples that I smoked.  For whatever reason one of the samples tended to flake quite a bit.  It held up for about an inch to an inch and a half before falling off on its own.  This was consistent in all 3 samples.  The burn was great on all 3 of the samples I smoked.Flavor :  (4.25) I might take heat in the comments section for this but this is perhaps one of the first non-Cuban cigars that I have had in quite a while that would probably have fooled me if I had done a blind, unbanded tasting.  If you live in the USA and are unable to get your hands on any Cuban cigars, try to hunt down one of these to get \u201cclose\u201d to what you would get in a decent Cuban cigar. While not quite \u201cthere\u201d, believe me, they got the blend and flavors pretty darn close.The Cordoba & Morales did have a loose pre-light draw with hints of earth and cedar.  I was concerned that the loose draw would impact the cigar but to my pleasant surprise it did not.  Still, I prefer my cigars to have a little more resistance to them.  Its unlit aroma was mild and pleasing, a nice humidor aroma with an earthy and nutty foot. The cigar itself had a very inviting sweet tobacco scent.Right off the bat on lighting the cigar I got some great full bodied flavour and tons of rich and creamy smoke output.  There was some very noticeable and pleasant spice present with a nice salty residue on my lips.The smoke output was outstanding and the black peppery finish was quite long but not overwhelming. The tobacco had a pleasant salt and peppery tingle on my lips which helped balance the sweeter texture of the smoke. Flavors in the first third were very enjoyable: sweet earthy notes with some sweet wood and mild hints of leather.  I was impressed by the smoke output and its texture.  The smoke was very rich and got a tad oilier as I finished the first third, leaving a nice residue on my tongue.  The flavors stayed consistent for the entire first third of the cigar with the only difference being a noticeable decline in the amount of pepper as I neared the end of the first third.  The smoke had a pleasant velvety texture to it with hints of creamy cocoa.The second third offered much of the same flavors as the first third and they remained full bodied.  I got nice sweet woodsy and leathery notes with some mild earthiness and occasional bursts of semi-sweet cocoa and coffee.  The smoke output was still thick with a nice creamy, velvety texture.  The finish was medium with primary hints of leather and a tingle of pepper on the finish.  The flavor profile remained consistent and comparing my notes, I was impressed to see that the flavors were consistent in all 3 samples I smoked.I was able to pick up some cedar and black pepper with occasional nuttiness and mild citrus as I approached the halfway mark.  The finish got a tad longer. Primary flavors were still a sweet woodsy, leathery cigar with hints of semi-sweet chocolate and coffee.  There was still some pepper on the finish and a pleasant salty balance on the lips.As I passed the halfway mark, hints of toasted nuttiness and some unsweetened coffee flavors entered the picture.  Because the first half of the cigar was on the sweeter side, the unsweetened notes are more detectable when they enter the picture.  However, the cigar never got harsh or bitter and for the most part, the notes of unsweetened coffee or dark chocolate did not last long.  The smoke was not as velvety at this stage, instead changing to a drier smoke with less residue on the palette. The cigar's finish was still peppery and long and it still had fantastic smoke output.The second half of the cigar offered pretty much more of the same.  There were no major flavor transitions to speak of.  The cigar remained consistent and pretty much one dimensional.  However, as I often note in my reviews, there\u2019s nothing wrong with a one dimensional cigar so long as the flavors are pleasing and this cigar wins on that end.As I approached the band I noted some increase in the nuttiness and earthy notes.  There were some occasional hints of unsweetened chocolate and tea with some citrus notes in the final third.  The smoke output remained thick and at times had some creamy and oily leather texture but for the most part was drier on the palate over the course of the second half of the cigar. The same was true in all three samples smoked.The rest of the cigar remained leathery, earthy and woodsy with the same flavor hints as already described. Nothing more.I started to get some bitterness with about an inch and a half remaining and that was where I decided to put the cigar to rest, not wanting to ruin an otherwise pleasurable experience.  The smoke remained cool, never really becoming hot.The Cordoba & Morales did become more earthy and \"grassy\" near the end but there was enough sweetness in the smoke to balance that.  The cigar left quite an enjoyable residue on my lips and the flavors were nicely balanced throughout.  By the end, the cigar\u2019s finish was medium with leather notes on the front end of the palate and some bitter chocolate and mild pepper at the back end.   This cigar\u2019s strength can creep up on you and I would classify it as a medium to full strength cigar.  You should definitely eat something before smoking it as the nicotine will catch up to you by the end.Value :  The MSRP for this cigar is $8.00. It is not carried by many retailers yet but those that do carry it are pretty much sticking to the MSRP.   It can be difficult to find but I hope that it becomes more readily available as it really is a very flavourful cigar.

Cordoba & Morales got this blend pretty close and have produced an above average cigar with a very enjoyable, yet predictable flavor profile.  A little more complexity and depth would certainly improve this already enjoyable cigar.What it lacks in complexity and depth it makes up for with the amount of flavor it packs. Granted the flavors never really change or develop while smoking the cigar, they do stay consistent and remain enjoyable for most of the smoke although they do tend to decline in intensity.  It is a little on the sweeter side which makes any bitter parts that much more noticeable however the cigar never gets harsh.The first of the 3 I had surprised me.  I had never heard of this brand until I received their samples for review.  I would highly recommend this cigar.  If you live in the USA and are unable to get your hands on Cuban cigars, you\u2019ve got to try this for yourself.If I had any criticisms of the cigar is that I felt it was just a tad loosely packed and it could use just a bit more tobacco.  This would improve the draw as well. Maybe it\u2019s a personal preference thing but I like a tad more resistance in my draw. The flavors, while enjoyable, become predictable and at times I was left wanting a little more.  The flavors do tend to subside as the cigar is smoked as does the spice.  Other than that and the stem particle I encountered, the cigar offered a very enjoyable and tasty smoking experience with great flavors accompanied by rich and creamy smoke output.

I simply reference them to see if the cigar smokes as it comes across.   This cigar had a nice rich chocolaty aroma with a hint of cedar.  The pre-light draw was very tasty with hints of chocolate, sweet cedar and rich aged tobacco with just a bit of peppery spice.On lighting the 20th Anniversary I got a lot of peppery spice and I mean a lot.  The spice was like a cayenne heat that overpowered the palate and it was tough to get any discernable flavors for the first couple of centimetres.Thankfully that blast of spice settled down to expose nice hints of rich chocolate, coffee and mild leather notes.  The back of the palate still had some spice but it was more tolerable.  I picked up orange peel and tea in the first third along with some roasted coffee bean and sweet cedar.The flavors became a tad earthier with some leather and tea in the second third but I still got semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and the occasional hint of citrus.  The smoke was rich, creamy and left a nice honey like residue on my palate.I picked up some bitterness near the halfway mark probably noticeable a bit more because up to that point it smoked more to the sweeter side.  The bitterness hung around for a little bit before giving way back to some of the aforementioned flavors. The bitterness was like burnt coffee, toasted almond with hints of earth. The smoke continued to be velvety though with a slight creamy residue on the palate. It wasn't quite like the honey texture it had earlier but still creamy.  There was still a little spice in the finish and once I got past the bitterness, it was right back to the sweeter chocolaty, coffee flavour profile.The final third still had spice, both at the front and back of the palate. The flavors were nuttier and had some more hints of tea and very light orange peel.During the final third, after removing the band, the Perdomo 20th Anniversary lost most of its sweetness and became an earthier cigar with more discernable dark roasted coffee bean, toasted nuts and more leather.The spice never really left the cigar but that's not a bad thing. The wrapper had a nice salty-sweet balance and the cigar was such that it transitioned without any harsh changes. The only problem was that for large parts of the cigar puff after puff tasted the same.  It could have used a little more complexity and depth.Value :  (3.75) Would I buy more? Yes.

The cigar I smoked for this review was no exception, and hopefully this review communicates everything I love about this smoke.Pre-light: I enjoyed my most recent 8-5-8 in my backyard on a partly cloudy to overcast day with temperatures around 80F, humidity around 50%, and little to no wind. I paired this cigar with the classiest of all drink pairings--tap water. A pre-light inspection of the cigar reveals a smooth and slightly velvety wrapper with no tears or major veins, although the wrapper is dappled with sunspots as seen in the picture. The stick feels generally firm overall with only one slightly spongy part. The wrapper smells only of tobacco, with some additional floral and cedar notes at the foot. The foot itself appears to be somewhat loosely rolled, but it is no great cause for concern. I generally punch cheaper cigars in order to avoid draw issues due to loosely rolled filler, and this cigar is no exception. In fact, even with a punch the draw is just a tad too lose. The cold draw tastes of a light tobacco flavor with a touch of sweetness.First third: Enough with the analysis; on to the smoke! I toasted the foot briefly and then lit her up. She jumped right to life, and the initial taste was rich, classic tobacco with some cedar and a creamy finish with a lingering honey sweetness. A retrohale reveals the Cameroon profile that I know and love: cream with a citrusy sweetness over a background of baking spice. The affects of the loose roll observed initially at the foot are now evident, and I'm forced to smoke slowly to avoid overheating. As the first third progresses the honey sweetness increases slightly, matching the other tastes perfectly as everything marries into the creamy, spicy, citrusy Cameroon profile draped on top of the core of tobacco and sweet cedar. The burn is generally straight with just a slight wave. The ash is slightly flaky and looks unstable, and it falls on its own at just a hair less than an inch. Second third: As seen in the pictures above, the cigar began to experience burn problems not long after ashing itself. I corrected the uneven burn by purging, but that wreaked havoc on the ash. The flavors from the first third maintain until about halfway through the second third, at which point the cream, citrus, and baking spice begin to diminish while the cedar intensifies and is joined by some earth; the slight sweetness remains constant. The finish is wet or juicy with that same sweetness, and I swear I even catch a stray note of cocoa in the finish at one point! The ash is as flaky as a bad skin condition and it falls on its own again.Final third: Moving into the final third, a touch of leather appears in the flavor profile with the cedar and earth. The sweetness remains constant and the overall feel increases noticeably in creaminess; this almost tastes like a different cigar than the one I started with, and both beginning and end have been so pleasant that it was like smoking two quality cigars! A faint bitterness appears so I begin purging after each puff. By the end, the profile is all creamy, sweet cedar and earth with a touch of leather and a hint of the citrus taste. The harshness and bitterness keeps increasing, so I let this one die with about an inch remaining.Conclusion: The Arturo Fuente Flor Fina 8-5-8 remains one of my favorite cheap smokes. The taste is delicious and complex, providing a welcome change from beginning to end. The construction may not be 100%, but an uneven burn and a slightly loose draw are a small price to pay for a fine-tasting cheap smoke such as this!", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/arturo-fuente-flor-fina.jpg?iv=16"}, "camacho 1962 torpedo": {"origin": "Origin : Honduras Format : Torpedo Size : 6.0\u2033 x 54 Wrapper : 3rd priming Habano-seed Criollo Filler : Honduran Cuban-seed long-leaf tobaccos Binder : Honduras Hand-Made Price : $7 each", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "camacho", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["I had a few of the coronas that seem pretty lackluster as well.

Their name is synonymous with powerhouse smokes but the truth is they have put out a few select cigars that are a bit more accessible to novice cigar smokers and those who enjoy a more refined smoke with less punch.  The Camacho Select comes to mind as a prime example of a medium bodied Camacho.  I\u2019m giving a bit away at the start here to say the 1962 is another one of Camachos medium bodied offerings.  The Camacho 1962 was made to commemorate the year that Julio Eiroa began his journey in cigar making after fleeing Castro\u2019s post revolutionary Cuba.Wrapped in an oily Criollo leaf, the 1962 is filled with \u201cextensively aged\u201d Honduran tobacco.  I always wonder why terms like \u201cextensively aged\u201d or \u201cextra aging\u201d are used instead of just telling us how long the tobacco is actually aged for.  My cynical nature believes that this so they can use whatever they need to in the cigars to keep turning them out once the \u201caged\u201d tobacco runs out. But that is just me being jaded and suspicious.  The band is very ornated and elegant looking and it has a second band on the foot completing a handsome presentation.You may be able to see in the picture that the wrapper was cracked in a couple of places on this specimen.  I don\u2019t know why or how it happened but I can say upfront that it was minor and did not affect the smoke.  It still burned just fine and held together as if it wasn\u2019t cracked at all.  This torpedo had a spongy feel to it which I have experienced in other Camacho torpedos, in particular the Camacho Select Torpedos.  The pre-light draw was very light like sucking air through a straw.  It started off very mild.  The flavors were weak and muddled, basic tobacco with a hint of spice.  It didn\u2019t take long for this cigar to start burning really hot.  I had to make a very concious effort to sip on it to keep it from getting bitter.  About midway through the flavors began to improve.  It started to become a nice medium bodied smoke dominated by leather and pepper with a nice leathery finish.  At this point the flavors stayed consistent and near the end the pepper starts to take over and it begins to develop some of that Camacho oomph.Overall this was a decent medium bodied smoke once I got past the lack luster start.  That said, I still wasn\u2019t that impressed with the smoke.  It was a bit one-dimensional.  The promise it started to show at the end has me thinking this just may have been a bum stick so I may have to revisit this sometime soon.  I have another Torpedo in my humidor so this is a prime canidate for a Redux review. For now though I can only give it a \u201cC\u201d.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Sam spent an number of years working for the Oliva Cigar Family.  He believes that every cigar has a sweet spot where it achieves the pinnacle of its flavors at some point during the smoke.  Sam wanted to see if he could create a cigar that could capture this sweet spot from the very first puff and hold it to the very last.  The Nub is what he came up with.  These cigars are very short and have huge ring gauges.  The smallest of the line is 54 ring, but the majority of them are 60 and above.  The largest of the line is a whopping 66 ring gauge.  Each size is supposedly the equivalent to a more traditional sized cigar.  For example this 460 Habano is supposed to have the same amount of tobacco in it as a 6.75\u2033 x 50 Churchill. I have smoked three of the Cameroon Nubs already and while they were decent flavor-wise, all three split apart on me and unraveled.  I hope I don\u2019t have the same problem with this Habano.  Let\u2019s see how it does\u2026The Nub Habano has a smooth, oily wrapper the color of milk chocolate.  The beefy ring gauge is a bit awkward but the draw is excellent. This cigar really did start off great from the get go.  It had a strong woody core accompanied by nuts and rich creaminess.  The flavors were very good and consistent throughout.  It lacks complexity but the flavors are excellent making it a very enjoyable smoke.  The ash was a bit flaky on the edges but it holds very firm.  I would have never needed to tap off the ash if I didn\u2019t want to.  I did have one problem with this smoke though.  Even though I took my time with it, it was a solid hour to smoke it, the burn was extremely hot and once I got about half way through it was almost too hot to hold and taking a puff became a dicey proposition.  It was difficult not to burn my fingers and lips while smoking it.  As short as this cigar is it becomes almost unsmokeable too early.  I had the same experience with one of the Cameroons that managed to hold together long enough form me to get that far.  On the bright side I did not have those kinds of construction issues with this cigar.Overall I was impressed with this cigar.  The flavors were really great and I enjoyed it a lot, but the heat issue makes me hesitant to smoke these very often.  I\u2019ll give it another try at some point but if I have the same experience I\u2019ll have to write these off.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Like the Anejos, the Hemingway Maduros are usually released around the holidays as a special treat for the fans and customers of Arturo Fuente cigars. I gave some more background on the Hemingway line of cigars in my review of the Hemingway Best Seller so click on over and check that out while you\u2019re here.The Signature Maduro has an oily, dark, toothy wrapper that is simply gorgeous. It has the look of old, well worn leather. Like all the Hemingway\u2019s the foot tapers down to a slightly odd looking nipple. The Hemingway and Hemingway Maduro provide an excellent example of how much a wrapper can affect the flavor of a cigar. The maduro is a completely different and unique experience compared to its Cameroon-wrapped sibling. The Cameroon version provides a classic Cameroon flavor with a sweet spice. The Signature Maduro starts off with flavors of cedar and a slight sweetness typical of a maduro wrapped cigar with flashes of black tea. As the smoke develops it gets very creamy and mellow. In the last third it starts to exhibit black pepper with a unique earthiness that I find hard to describe. It makes me think of wet earth, almost like I am tasting the rich damp soil the tobacco was grown in.The construction, as is always the case with any Hemingway was superb. The burn was razor sharp and the ash was grey and rough looking but held firm. It produces thick clouds of white smoke with a rich aroma. There is just nothing bad to say about this cigar. It is a wonderful experience from start to end and as good as the Cammie version of this cigar is, it pales in comparison to the complex experience that the maduro delivers. The Signature Maduro and the Work of Art Maduro are by far my favorites of the Hemingway line. If you have never had one, you simply must find one and try it. I usually don\u2019t give maduros this much love, but this is a superb cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The wrapper comes from Ecuador which is different from the traditional Nicaraguan wrapper used by Don Pepin Garcia.  The cigar line offers different vitolas for enjoyment:  a Torpedo (No. 2 -5.5 X 54); a Toro (No. 3 - 6 X 49); Long Panatela (No. 4 - 7.5 X 38); Grand Corona (Cedros Deluxe Eminentes - 5.6 X 46); Lonsdale (Cedros Deluxe Cervantes - 6.5 x 44); and today\u2019s feature cigar, the No. 1 Robusto.  The No. 3 was named \u201c2009 Best Cigar of the Year\u201d by Cigar Aficionado, and it received a very high rating of 94.  The cigar features its own website; however, the section that covers the My Father\u2019s line is still under construction.Appearance :  The wrapper is a Havano-Rosado which has a very nice milk chocolate color to it.  The cigar does not seem to have an oily sheen to it although it seems very soft in the hands.  The wrapper offers barnyard and hay notes.The cigar consists of a triple cap although it is hard to make out all three caps.The band represents a beautiful work of art with an elaborate \u201cMF\u201d written in a large cursive font.  The family\u2019s name \u201cGarcia & Garcia\u201d is written under the MF.  The band has a salmon colored background which matches well with the red tones of the cigar.  Other smaller drawings round out the design of the band.Construction :  The cigar appears veiny which may be a cause of concern.  There are no noticeable soft spots in the cigar; it is a very firm cigar.The Robusto No. 1 offers a bit of resistance in the pre-light draw although this could be due to how tight the tobacco seems to be packed.The smoke is not too abundant, and it seems to rise fairly quickly.  The ash seems pretty tight although some spots were flaky.  The color is very bright white.  The cigar has a beautiful and even burn.A good inch ash was obtained before having to tap it off on the ashtray.The band was glued very tight, and rather than damaging the cigar by removing it, I decided to leave it around the cigar.Flavor :  After cutting the cigar with a Boston Cigar Company Little Guy \u201cV\u201d cutter, the pre-light draw has notes of honey and molasses.  The foot offers a sweet, floral scent which resembles honeysuckle or even lavender.Upon lighting up the cigar, hints of pepper and leather were immediately noticed.  The finish is definitely a very long one.  On the retrohale, a very nice leathery aroma lingered in the nasal passages, and the retrohale itself was not very overpowering.About halfway into the cigar, roasted nuts were perceived.  This was a well-pronounced taste.Value :  This cigar is an expensive one (around $8.25/stick) for a Robusto.  This one falls under the category of a special occasion cigar.  For me, it is just a bit too much money for a \u201cgo-to\u201d daily cigar.  However, a box of these would make a nice gift to honor any cigar smoker\u2019s father.Another \u201cphilosophical\u201d problem I have with this cigar is that since I could not remove the band, I really smoked about 3.75 of the cigar.  Now, I am sure that with some work, the band could have been removed, and I would have been able to enjoy an extra 0.5 in. or so.  Again, I did not want to take a chance and damage the cigar.Overall Rating :  This No.1 Robusto featured a very nice range of balanced flavors.  The only problem I found was the price; one can get extremely good robusto cigars at a more affordable cost.It was a very enjoyable medium-to-full body smoke with a long finish and a pleasant retrohale.  I am a big Pepin Garcia fan as I have not found any of his cigars that I did not enjoy.This post was written by Ed.

For those new smokers out there that are wondering where to start your cigar journey, well I\u2019d look at the Fuente family.  The Hemingway series was released in 1983 with the 6 x 47 Signature and the entire series is still strong on the market today.  In case you weren\u2019t aware the word \u201cHemingway\u201d refers to a certain shape used to roll a cigar (figurado body with tapper perfecto foot).This should be a perfect size smoke for folks that have to bear the cold outside winter weather.  Let\u2019s see if the performance is worth it too\u2026The pre-light on the Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story showed a medium brown rough wrapper with a sloppy uneven cap.  The foot (nipple) on the cigar was cracked (on both samples I smoked) and the cold smell was a sweet fresh cut hay.  The band was a typical Arturo Fuente Hemingway however the interesting thing for me was the shape of the cigar.  It never fails to amaze me that these are hand-made items and someone in the world was able to shape the cigar in this format (with the help of molds).  Finally the cold draw was somewhat tight with an interesting honeysuckle type tastes.Lighting the cigar proved to be somewhat of a difficulty due to the crack that was on the foot of the stick (had to re-light multiple times).  After finally getting the cigar going I was greeted with woody, sweet, caramel hints with wood being the most dominant of the flavors.  The draw showed a nice resistance with an aroma that reminded me of a burning maple wood fire.With the cigar\u2019s size not being very big I quickly moved into the second third.  In fact the second and final thirds were very similar.  The burn on the stick became wavy however it only needed one touch up.  The draw remained solid with tastes also remaining the same, a nice natural woody sweetness.  Near the finish the cigar did get some unusual charred tastes but nothing too terrible.  I would certainly classify the cigar in the mild to medium body range.To sum up the Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story I would say this cigar is a perfect smoke for those of us that are outside winter smokers (on those days when you are able to step out and get in a smoke).  The cigar is not terribly complex however does offer some nice \u201cwarming\u201d aspects, and only takes about 35 \u2013 40 minutes to smoke.  As far as stocking them in my permanent rotation, that probably won\u2019t happen, but pick a few up and see what you think.Pre-Light: 6 pts. Smoking: 7 pts.

Since I live in Vancouver, one quick trip to Washington and I picked up box of Prensados.

I was stuck with the box of unpleasant surprise.", "Sinisa,", "AB Prensado was especially surprising as number 1. It never even came close to hitting my radar when i came out with my Top 10 for this website last year nor did it make any other reviewers list last year. I think many online reviewers don\u2019t put much stock in CA\u2019s list since they revealed they only smoke the first inch of every cigar for their reviews. The serious cigar geeks seem to read publications like this one instead to get a better grasp of what a cigar is like. Most independent online reviewers can more objectively (if there is such a thing) review a cigar because most sites don\u2019t depend on ad revenue from said cigar companies. Usually about $10k-$15k in ad money to just get a review with CA. So think about why a cigar like this snuck up the list, or how many of those sticks got on there at all.", "Aaron, I think another reason why sites like this and other independent reviewers put more effort into their reviews is because unlike the high gloss publications, most of us pay for our own cigars, mostly reviewing cigars that we spent our hard earned money on.  As a result, it is imperative that the cigar be smoked as far as possible in order to adequately rate its complexity and more importantly to determine whether it is worthy of more of our hard earned money.  Let\u2019s face it, this is not a cheap passion.", "I am glad I read this review because I thought I got a bad batch. I let them sit for two months and even \u201cdry boxed\u201d my last two but found the exact same things as dr fever. I hate when my cigars are uneven, I am always careful to light them correctly and rotate while smoking but these ALWAYS burned uneven. They all went out at the soft spot in the middle and I HATE than when my cigar goes out!  Again I take great care to keep my sticks lit. So thank you for confirming that I did not have a bad batch but only had a bad cigar!", "I\u2019ve tried smoking 4 of these cigars (2 Churchill\u2019s + 2 Robusto\u2019s from a sampler pack) so far and my experience is more or less the same as the reviewer\u2019s.

Good to know theres other Canadians in Ontario enjoying the good life.

My experience w/ the Churchills is exactly like DrFever\u2019s, but I find that the Torpedoes smoke wonderfully and deliver a much more enjoyable flavor profile with much less overwhelming \u201cheat\u201d as described, and I find it a go-to cigar with some scotch.  Maybe the Torpedo should have been closer to the top spot instead?", "I live in FL. and I have been smokng these churchills for 3 months. I experiance the opposite. Even burn with a nice ash, amazing 3 different flavors thru out the stick. I think the trick is you have to rotate these sticks around in your humidor, so it can burn evenly. I did have 1 get out of control, but overall this is 1 of my favorite cigars. Beside my all around favorite the Montecristo Media Noche #2. Excellent. On cigarbid.com I wait for the Free Fall to get them for 4.50 a sick. The ash can last about 3\u2033 long before you have to knock it off yourself. At 6.1 x 54, this cigar last about 1 1/2 long. But the Prensado Churchill, I will always pick them up too. That\u2019s just my opinion. And of course everyone has a different opinion on every stogie. Try a Montecristo Media Noche # 2 once. You will be amazed!", "I am quite relieved to find out I am not the only one baffled by these cigars.   I bought two boxes when the review came out, and was given a third as a gift.  They are a disaster.  CA should be ashamed of the rating given.  They just won\u2019t burn correctly , and the flavor is odd at best.  I let them sit in my humidor for months, tried one again just yesterday, same result.  A struggle , then it went out as usual, and I said No Mas.  I am done . Stuck with an expensive pile of useless sticks!!", "I just had one of these in Robusto and I have to say I couldn\u2019t finish it. The flavor was at best tolerable, nothing to write home about.

While its not better than any of the padron line it is a good cigar.  I let mine rest for two months.  That seemed to get the humidity right for a decent burn.  I didn\u2019t get the harshness others mentioned.  The flavors, for me, became richer, deeper and better from third to third.  Either I got lucky or it\u2019s a damn fine cigar.  Either way I\u2019m okay.  Padron 7000 is still much better and 1926 and 1964 speak for themselves.", "I must say ,you\u2019re right about this Cigar, I\u2019m smoking one now ,and it will be the 1st and last one I do,", "Great review that pretty much sums up my thoughts about this stick. I\u2019ve never been an Alec Bradley fan. Ever since I tried their Trilogy cigar on the advice of a friend I have looked to avoid this brand.", "I just finished my first Prensado Robusto. And like so many others I was disappointed. A few weeks ago when I picked the current copy of CA I purchased a AlecBradly Black Market. As i enjoyed this smoke, I thought it safe to purchase a half box of the Presando cigars as it was the CA #1 cigar for 2011.  Right from the start there was a problem, as a layer of the leaf immediately pealed off from the punch I gave it.  The cigar lit fine and the draw was good.  The first 3 to 4 draws were very hot. The burn throughout the cigar was uneven and the ash dropped at less than 1 inch of burn. I also, like others, needed to relight it several times. This is a cigar that must be puffed on frequently to keep it going.  The flavors were slightly peppery (which I enjoy) but too much leather.  The final 1/4 of the cigar started to give me a headache so I finally put it down. I still have 9 of these cigars to get through, and I will, but I will not be buying these again. Sorry Mr. Rubin and CA,but this is not a great cigar.  I find the Oliva O and the Oliva V much better cigars. Tomorrow I will try the CA 2012 #1 cigar, Flor de las Antillas, and hope it restores my faith in CA ratings.", "Yes to two points CA reviews and rating are sometime out of whack and sin tax is Canada is ridiculous. Yet I was able to find and was recommended Alec Bradley Prensado Churchill for $12.50 a stick in Canada. I have yet to smoke it. Once I smoke I let you know the result and if it was worth the money.", "Agreed, this is an overrated stick (double-T). It was a bit spongy, required a lot of babysitting and touching up, and my stick was very, very mellow, especially for a full-bodied cigar.", "I think what we have here is inconsistency.  I just smoked a Robusto and your description of the last half of your Churchill matches my experience as a whole but somewhat better.  Double all the goods you mentioned, stay on top of the burn and it really is a great smoke.  Worth the gamble?  If you can get one at CBid\u2019s price I recommend taking the chance..", "Spot on review. Picked one of these up as part of a low priced bundle introductory offer from Cigars dot com \u2026 So I can\u2019t complain too much as I paid $30 for 10 sticks + a terrible humidor. (Including a Cohiba, Macaduno, Ghurka, Rocky Patel). I was shocked when I learned that this was the CA cigar of the year. It burned terribly uneven with a jagged ash. I needed to relight it less than a quarter of the way through. The taste was harsh. I am admittedly not a fan of Maduro, preferring a medium body like Macanudo or Punch. Still, I do appreciate a good smoke and was let down. I probably wouldn\u2019t buy this again even if it wasn\u2019t the CA cigar of the year. The price was right for me but still \u2026 It looked very beautiful and that\u2019s about as far as it went. This worries me as I recently bought a Partagas 160 (a foolish impulse buy at $150 per stick). I dread another overrated rating cigar experience. Tolerable at $10.50 but at $150 \u2026 It would be very defeating to have the same experience with the 160 as with this. Seems like a consensus that the Alec Bradley was uneven and hard to keep going.", "My last two boxes of Prensado Churchills have been stunning, but it is three years on since the cigar won COTY (and also since your review).

Cigar smokers and manufacturers alike refer to it as the bible when it comes to the cigar lover\u2019s lifestyle and culture.  A high rating in this publication can make your sales soar, while at the same time negative feedback can often leave your cigars collecting dust on the back shelf of the walk-in humidor.Perhaps no list is as eagerly awaited each year than their list of the year\u2019s best cigars.  One cigar gets to be crowned \u201cCigar of the Year\u201d and, for as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been making it a point to ensure that I get my hands on the number one so that I can see for myself what the hype is about.  On some occasions I had already smoked their top rated cigar while on others I hadn\u2019t. The last cigar to be crowned Cigar Aficionado\u2019s cigar of the year was the Alec Bradley Prensado.  Many \u2018aficionados\u2019 found this selection surprising/controversial.  In fact, I had never paid much attention to this cigar before, having tasted some of Alec Bradley\u2019s other offerings and not being too pleased with them.  However, because this cigar won 2011\u2019s cigar of the year, I was compelled to give it a go. I often agree with the magazine\u2019s overall impressions. While I may not think as highly or as lowly as they do in some of their ratings, usually, I can agree on a good smoke or a bad one only disagreeing with the rating itself.  Can we really crown something \u201cthe best\u201d given that taste is so subjective?Needless to say, the winning cigar, especially if it is a non-Cuban, can pretty much be assured of selling out their supply in short order.  Cuban cigars are different because they cannot be purchased in the United States, one of the biggest markets for the aforementioned publication.Having set my eyes on the Prensado, I was fortunate enough to get my hands on one during my frequent visits to the United States.  Thankfully I live a short drive to the border and normally pick up a few non-Cuban cigars when I cross the bridge. Living in Canada, the demand for non-Cuban cigars is not that great but we also have to contend with some hefty tobacco taxes.  I was uneasy about spending over $20.00 one of these cigars here in Canada so I waited until one of my trips to the U.S. to pick up a stick.I picked one up in early February, paying $10.75 for it. Buying them by the box will save on the per-cigar price, a practise that is against the law here in Canada.  That is, you cannot offer a discount if you buy the box but instead must pay the actual cigar price multiplied by the number of sticks.With all that said and out of the way, the other night was a perfect mild evening with little to no humidity and no breeze.  It was the perfect outdoor condition to enjoy a cigar, and a Churchill at best given that I would need some time to get through this 7 inch smoke.  Therefore, enough rambling... time to dig into the review.  Is the reigning champion worthy of the its title?Appearance :  This box-pressed cigar measures 7 inches long with a 48 ring gauge. The cigar is manufactured in Honduras and is composed of both Honduran and Nicaraguan tobacco.  The main feature of this cigar is the lush and well aged (2006) Corojo wrapper grown in the Trojos region of the Honduran Jalapa Valley.

The draw remained consistent but as I said, it had a tendency to want to go out on me if I did not take frequent draws.  The first re-light was required approximately 2 cm above the band and the second one just beneath it.  Deductions were given for the very uneven burn and the re-lights.Flavor :  This is where I disagree with the aforementioned publication and with many of the reviews I have seen since the crowning.The pre-light draw gave me a very typical maduro tobacco taste.  It had no resistance and provided woodsy and earthy tones.  The foot of the cigar had a deep earthy aroma as did the body of the cigar itself.I toasted the foot and proceeded to light the cigar at which time I was immediately greeted with a very full-bodied spice with exceptional smoke volume.  I tasted hints of wood and leather.  The spice was strong with a very noticeable, almost distracting \u201cheat\u201d.  It was not a typical peppery spice but was a longer lasting heat, best described as cayenne pepper or even a jalapeno spice.  The draw had a long finish with the spice overshadowing the leathery, woodsy flavours.   I noticed hints of thick cocoa, bitter chocolate and to be quite frank, I was reminded of burnt espresso like when it is simply served too hot causing the coffee to go very bitter.  The best way to describe the flavour I got out of the first couple of centimetres was a burnt, unsweetened espresso with hints of wood and thick cocoa.  There was certainly a lot going on.  The spice remained constant and perhaps was a bit over the top.  The burn started to go wavy at approximately 1cm.The cigar remained very spicy for the first third.  The finish remained long.  It continued to offer hints of wood and leather especially noticeable in the finish. Hints of bitter espresso remained.  The ash was typical of maduro cigars, dark and toasted grey.  It remained firm and fell off on its own at approximately 1.5 inches into the cigar.  It was at that point that the burn became very uneven.  As the first third ended so did the overpowering spice. That is not to say that the spice disappeared but it became less of a distraction.The cigar mellowed out a bit at the start of the second third at which point the burn needed a correction. Much of the overwhelming spice and bitterness subsided and gave way to milder hints of earth and wood. I started to feel some very faint hints of salt on my lips at this point. No longer was the spice lingering at the back of my throat. At the halfway mark the volume of cigar smoke declined.  The burn got away from me again and required its second correction.  I was not getting the harsh bitterness anymore and the intensity of the spice subsided to a palatable level.  Hints of musty wood with tobacco and roasted coffee emerged.  The overall intensity of the flavour declined noticeably.Past the halfway mark the flavours became much more muted and the burn again started to waver.  I could start to feel the nicotine at this point and the spice became more like a cracked pepper heat. The smoke volume decreased and the bitterness was replaced with a  more palatable sweetness.  I picked up hints of cocoa and slight citrus with some coffee tones that were balanced by mild saltiness on the lips.During the final third of the cigar there was much less spice/pepper.  The cigar became much smoother and sweeter/creamier.  The harsh bitterness disappeared and I was starting to taste hints of sweet chocolate and thick coffee.  The cigar needed to be re-lit just before removing the band and again just past it.  It wants to be smoked and long pauses will cause the cigar to go out.  The volume of smoke noticeably dimished  in the last 2 inches.  The ash became flaky following the halfway mark falling off more frequently, perhaps every cm or two, perhaps because of the uneven burn.The cigar started off as a very full-bodied cigar ending more medium-bodied. It was a medium/strong strength. The cigar flavours were very complex.  However, complexity is only a good thing if the flavours accompanying that complexity are pleasing.  Unfortunately, I found that for the most part they weren't.  The cigar did not become really enjoyable for me until long after the halfway mark of the cigar and that is just too long for me to wait for the cigar to balance out. I can\u2019t imagine having to wait 5 inches into a 7 inch cigar to finally experience balanced flavours. If I was not intending to review it I would probably have put the cigar to rest much earlier.  Most of the time I was fighting the burn and battling bitterness and harsh spice.  The predominant flavour was that of a woodsy/earthy cigar.  I do love peppery cigars but this spice was just overwhelming, like someone sprinkled cayenne pepper into the cigar.  It offered short hints of lush cocoa at the start but these were very short lived.  The lush cocoa and coffee sweetness that I normally get from maduro cigars re-emerged later on into the smoke but simply took too long to develop.  The cigar lasted almost an hour and 45 minutes with the last 2 inches becoming difficult to draw and stay lit.Value :  $10.70 for the cigar of the year (cheaper if bought by the box in the U.S.) and for a 7 inch smoke lasting 15 minutes shy of 2 hours is amazing value. If you enjoy the cigar then the cost of the cigar is not an issue.  It offers exceptional value for such a long lasting smoke.  However, I did not particularly enjoy the cigar and will not be buying another.  I find it hard to rate value because much of what I deem to be of value must be accompanied by a reason or desire to spend the money to begin with.  As I did not enjoy the cigar I cannot honestly say that it has any value for me.  However, on a general level, I must admit that this 7 inch Churchill is priced right for those that enjoy it.  It certainly won\u2019t bust your wallet unless you are buying it in an unfriendly tobacco tax market like Canada.Overall Rating :  I don\u2019t agree with the Cigar Aficionado tasters/rating.  I can think of many more cigars that I found exceptionally more appealing than this one.  I think their tasters were being somewhat generous.  Maybe they tasted something I didn\u2019t or perhaps I had a bad sample.  This is not the first time that the number one cigar caused controversy in the smoking world.  I am not going to like this cigar simply because a publication thought it was the best of the year.  Too many people simply follow the leader and play along in that regard, having their initial impressions swayed by the knowledge that they are smoking the cigar of the year.I don\u2019t think I recall seeing reviews of this cigar before the rating was released but since being crowned the best of 2011 I\u2019ve seen many which is why I couldn't wait to taste it for myself.  I am often left wondering if people like the cigar because of its crown or if they actually find the smoke pleasing.Much of my positive rating for this cigar was based on appearance.  The cigar really looked sexy and I really wanted this cigar to be better.  I absolutely loved its appearance.

Flavor wise there really is much to talk about.  It has a very generic sweet maduro flavor that never really changes.  It is not a bad cigar but it is a little boring.  This cigar could be a good intro to maduros for a new cigar smoker, but it doesn\u2019t have much to offer more experienced smokers.  It is not a full bodied smoke by my standards either.  When I think full bodied, I think Tatuaje, Cruzado, VSG, or La Flor Dominicana.  This cigar is medium-bodied at best.  I had hoped to get more from this cigar.

The original is an excellent Honduran made cigar available in a wide range of sizes.  The artwork on the dress boxes and bands is beautiful and the presentation of the cigars is quite handsome.  That goes for both the original line and the Edicion Especial.  The true original La Aroma de Cuba was a Cuban-made cigar and was reported to be one of Winston Churchill's favorites which is what gives the brand name a bit of cache.  This special edition of the brand is a Nicaraguan-made cigar, blended and made by the now famous and highly decorated Jose \u2018Pepin\u2019 Garcia.  The Ecuadorian sun grown wrapper has a unique hue and oily sheen, and it covers rich Nicaraguan tobacco.Not your typical \u201cPepin\u201d smoke. That is the first thing that jumps out at me. From the beginning you notice his trademark black pepper start is missing. That is OK, because what you do get is fantastic. Rich notes of cinnamon and all-spice combined with flashes of cedar make for dramatic start in its own right. Balance isn\u2019t the word I would use for this cigar. It has some serious peaks and valleys. After an amazing rich start the cigar mellowed a bit. Flavors were mainly cedar with a muddled earthiness. It picked back up again a little past the halfway mark with pronounced flavors of roasted nuts that swapped places back and forth with a sharp earthiness. There were some subtle undertones of dark chocolate or cocoa. Seeing it written out doesn\u2019t do it justice. It was actually much better than it looks in print. It started to get muddled again near the nub but it was time to put it down anyway. This was a very interesting medium bodied smoke. One I would very much like to try again.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Cuba.  Today, the Cuban version still exists but there are also non-Cuban LADC's produced. The La Aroma de Cuba Edicion Especial are rolled and blended by Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia for Ashton Distributors.  At the time of their making Pepin was crawling into new territory by using the Ecuadorian wrapper instead of his traditional Nicaraguan standard leaves.Cigar Aficionado did rate the La Aroma de Cuba Edici\u00f3n Especial No.5 its #4 cigar of the year in 2008 (which to some means absolutely nothing) however it certainly encouraged me to pick a couple up to try.  And that\u2019s exactly what I did back in 2009.  Since then these cigars have sat in my humidor (4 years) almost as a long lost friend.  So, today is the day I pull them out to see if these once lovely cigars are still making our hearts and palates wanting more.On to the review\u2026The pre-light on my La Aroma de Cuba Edici\u00f3n Especial No. 5 was perfect (not something that happens often).  Smell had heavy barnyard and tobacco accents.  The wrapper was an absolute gorgeous smooth light sandy brown, just perfect!  An excellent point was constructed on the tip of this belicoso and the foot was completely jam packed full of leaves.  The band was appealing to the eye with its colorful detailed artwork.  The cold draw showed small hints of spice with the perfect resistance leading to sweet tobacco and cocoa notes.The cigar immediately opened as an unexpected spice bomb however quickly settled into silky sweet chocolate tastes.  The perfect draw lead to a wonderful powdery salt and pepper ash.  Cigar had an alluring creamy aroma and settled nicely into the medium-full bodied range.The second third of the La Aroma de Cuba Edici\u00f3n Especial No. 5 continued to have a perfect burn.  The cigar released a lot of thick creamy white smoke and tastes turned to a bready cream and vanilla with an undertone of cocoa on the finish.  Cigar really had a good mouth feel while smoking.  Absolutely a true pleasure to smoke!Moving into the final third the cigar continued to perform nothing short of perfect.  Tastes continued along the same cocoa creamy profile while adding touches of wood to the palate.  Aroma ended in a relaxing woody, leathery, creamy mixture.My Final thoughts on the La Aroma de Cuba Edici\u00f3n Especial No. 5 are nothing short of great.  This cigar was exceptional in every aspect and I highly suggest not passing on these sticks.  It\u2019s reassuring to know that a once great treasure is still an excellent choice to this day.  I will certainly be buying a box or two of these in hopes that they sit and mature as these review examples have.  You won\u2019t go wrong with these cigars!Pre-Light: 10 pts. Smoking: 9 pts. Overall Experience: 9 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb. For more of his articles and his scoring guide, click here.

The Ortega Serie \u2018D\u2019 Maduro features a nearly flawless San Andres Maduro leaf wrapped around generous portions of Nicaraguan long leaf fillers. The San Andres leaf is the color of dark chocolate and has a slight oily sheen to it. The length of the six-inch stick is plump and expertly rolled and finished with a gentle box press. The triple thick cap is squarely mounted and cuts cleanly with my punch cutter.The pungent aroma of freshly cut alfalfa and earth is evident in the wrapper leaf while the foot gives off scents of cherries, cocoa bean, and ground pepper. The cold draw is open and easy, producing dark, earthy flavors of cocoa and earth while leaving the tingle of pepper on the lips. The first few puffs are dominated by rich tobacco and intense black pepper. The pepper fades a bit after the first five minutes but is still present on the back of the pallet. A gentle undertone of cocoa joins in midway through the first third, along with a citrus tanginess on the tip of the tongue. The second third begins with a toasty nuance as well as dark, earthy flavors of smoked hickory and cocoa. The pepper flavor disappears completely by the final third, which is predominantly earthy with a sweet aftertaste of dried fruit.The Ortega Serie \u2018D\u2019 draws perfectly, producing huge plumes of white smoke with each pull. The ash is a dark grey color with coal colored striations. The ash looks a bit flakey but is actually incredibly solid, growing to almost two inches before the initial drop. The ash drops a total of three times during the seventy-five minute smoke. The burn is slow and even, progressing flawlessly through each third. The burn is cool enough, allowing me to enjoy the cigar down to the nub.The Ortega Serie \u2018D\u2019 is a full strength kicker. I smoked it before eating and regretted my decision within the first third of the stick. Along with the full strength comes full, complex flavor.  The draw is perfect and the burn is superb. Eddie Ortega has certainly set the bar high with this launch.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com. Click here for her latest posts.

Burn was very even, and the ash clung to the end for an inch or so.Flavor :  Initial flavors are coffee, strong dark chocolate, and tobacco.  I was surprised, because I had expected mostly cedar.  The cedar comes through in the aroma, with a bit of peppery spiciness.  The coffee and chocolate get stronger through the middle third, and in the final third, the chocolate took over as the main flavor.  The coffee fades into the backdrop, along with the cedar undertones and the tobacco flavor.  I love chocolate, so I was pretty thrilled with this flavor profile.  This would be perfect for dessert.Value :  At only about $7.00 a stick, this is an excellent cigar.  I can\u2019t complain about the price at all, and I could easily see going out and getting a box of 20.Overall Rating :  For chocolate and dessert lovers, Ortega Serie D is a very good choice.  Some smokers may be deterred by the rustic appearance, but I enjoyed this aspect of the cigar.  I think it lends character.  It is just one more mark of the fact that these cigars are rolled by hand.  The flavor profile is anything but rough.  I am definitely looking forward to purchasing more and enjoying them with dessert in the evenings.", "flavor": " Initial flavors are coffee, strong dark chocolate, and tobacco.

Being that my wife and I had spent our honeymoon there and I\u2019ve been there on business a few times, she wanted to know where to go. Even though I knew she wasn\u2019t a cigar smoker, I told her to visit the Casa Fuente club, located in the Forum Shops in Caesar\u2019s Palace. \u201cHave a mojito and enjoy yourself,\u201d I said to her. While she was there, she called up and said that she was getting me a cigar from the club. And sure enough, when she returned home, I found a Casa Fuente bag waiting for me with a Casa Fuente House Cigar inside.Now, I have been to the club before and have smoked a few of these over the years. I even get a pilsner glass each time I visit. But for whatever reason (probably being that between the cigars and the number of Cuban drinks I take in while there), I never really get around to taking notes on the cigar. Needless to say, I was quite happy to sit down with this cigar and give it a thorough inspection.Taking the cigar out of the wrapper and giving it a look over, I was greeted with an attractive looking cigar. The Cameroon wrapper really helped highlight the gold and maroon ornamented band. The only flaws I found with the veiny Cameroon wrapper was two tiny spots. Perhaps moisture from traveling to the club from the factory or a flaw in the wrapper itself. It didn\u2019t cause any issues with smoking. I also felt a soft spot in the middle of the cigar, which I think caused a couple of relights at the halfway point during the smoking time.Using a wooden match and punch, my first draw was open and easy. Taking in the flavors for a couple of minutes, I would offer up earthy hints and an almost dull spice to the flavor palette. The spice, very soft overall, only hit the very back of the mouth. The flavors overall are a bit on the stronger side, but I can\u2019t say for sure if I would consider this completely full bodied. A few steps back from that perhaps. A nice white smoke is the by-product from the draw, but I felt it dissipated into the room rather quickly. The ash had a more deeper gray/black tones to it and be warned: it is flaky and will easily fall. I had ash in my lap in the first ten minutes of the cigar. I\u2019d also say that this cigar had a shorter finish than others; it didn\u2019t stay with me as long as I thought it would.As I mentioned earlier, I did have a couple of relights about halfway through the cigar. However, that was the entirety of the problems with the cigar. With this size, expect around a two hour smoke time.This is a great cigar, no doubt about it. Everything except the price anyway. I will say that if you are in Vegas and you get a chance to visit the Casa Fuente Club, be sure to have one of these cigars and a drink (or several), and enjoy the atmosphere of the club. If you are able to take a few home with you, save lighting these up for a special occasion.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

The Rocky Patel Company promotes this cigar as a medium-bodied one but I personally found it a bit on the milder side but perhaps this may be skewed a bit since I normally smoke strong cigars.The blend for this cigar is made up of primarily tobacco grown in Nicaragua and is wrapped with a very rustic and, in my own personal opinion, ugly-looking Connecticut broadleaf wrapper.  The cigars themselves are manufactured at Patel\u2019s Tavicusa factory in Estel\u00ed, Nicaragua.Appearance :  It is often said we eat with our eyes before we eat with our mouth and cigar smoking is no different.  At first glance, this cigar looks very rustic with a nice dark oily sheen wrapper but admittedly very rustic and veiny in appearance.I liked the color of the band and the packaging (which adds to the cost of the cigar).  The cigar comes with a second band promoting the cigar as the Private Cellar.  As I said though, despite the nice oily sheen to the wrapper, the cigar had many visible and distracting veins which perhaps explained why the burn was so uneven during my smoke. The cigar looked a tad rushed in construction as evidenced in the photographs.   The foot looked a little squished and the press and roll did not appear consistent. There were a lot of distracting veins in the cigar but the seams were only slightly visible and tight.Construction :  The cigar was extremely spongy to the touch despite being stored, as all my other cigars, at an RH of 68%.  As can be seen on the photograph of the foot, it appeared as though less tobacco than normal was used.  Maybe this was done on purpose but I have smoked many Patels and this by far felt like the spongiest of them all.  This led to the cigar burning a bit quicker than most Toros but the smoke always remained cool.  The cigar did extinguish itself about halfway through and needed touch-ups along the way both to keep it lit and to correct the burn.The ash was a white/brown color and extremely flaky, usually falling off at between half an inch to an inch.  It needed 3 touch-ups, the second sample needed 4.     I had a feeling the loosely packed tobacco would affect the burn and it did.  Thankfully the draw was for the most part good and the smoke was cool and thick.Overall I got the impression just by examining the cigar and the way it smoked that it was rushed in its construction.  For a cigar bearing Patel\u2019s Private Cellar label and promoted as being Patel\u2019s optimal blend, one would think a little more care should have been taken in the cigar\u2019s manufacturing. Perhaps it might be time to acknowledge that this is one of those brands that has followed the path of many others by simply producing too many cigar lines resulting in construction issues as workers rush to get out the many different blends offered.Flavor :  This cigar overall was of medium strength and medium body.  I smoked two of these to get a good feel of the cigar.  They were consistent but both average.The pre-light aroma of the RP Private Cellar was pleasing.  Natural tobacco with some earthy woodsy notes.  The cigar held up well to my straight guillotine cut.  The pre-light draw offered little in the way of resistance (a little too open for my liking) but offered pleasing hints of roasted coffee, cocoa and leather.The first third evidenced some dark cocoa, roasted espresso, earth  and some nuttiness. The spice was very faint and in fact was very tough to even notice.  Exhaling from my nose wasn\u2019t uncomfortable at all and allowed for a little more spice to enter the profile.  For the most part, the cigar lacked any complexity.  What you got from the start of the cigar is what you got near the end with one exceptio ... there did tend to be a slight increase in spice as you worked your way down the cigar. It wasn\u2019t an overwhelming black pepper like spice though, instead, more of a spicy pepper.  It remained mild and never got overpowering.The second third offered much of the same as the first third with a tad more toasted nuttiness noticeable with occasional sweetness that resembled some black currant or raisins.  Just a touch of salt was on the lips and the finish remained short to medium.  The smoke output remained good, not exceptional.The final third had a little bit more spice but much of the same flavors.  If asked to describe the primary flavor I would have to say that it was an earthy cigar with plenty of woodsy notes.  It reminded me of a walk in the forest at dawn.  Secondary flavors were roasted espresso bean, dark cocoa with only very occasional hints of sweetness. The smoke was average and far from great. It lacked real texture or enough flavor dynamic or complexity to keep my interest. For the most part it only gave tobacco aromas with none of the velvety richness that I\u2019ve gotten from some of Patel\u2019s other blends.Value :  This cigar isn\u2019t cheap because of whom it\u2019s made by.

The package arrived in good condition. When I opened the solid wooden box, the smell was wonderful. Cedar from the box mixed with the smell of the cigars.I took the cellophane off of one of them and noticed that they were just a little dry. I put the remainder of them in my humidor to rehydrate, and went outside to smoke the one that I had unwrapped. It was a good cigar, well constructed, and cosmetically very attractive. It burned a little hotter than I liked, but I wrote that off to dryness, and to my smoking it too fast. I resolved to wait two weeks to smoke the next one.Two weeks later, I took one of the Medinas out of the humidor, and removed the cellophane. The cigar felt solid, but had appreciably hydrated in the intervening time. The smell was a little stronger than what I would get from a Macanudo. The wrapper was similar to what I would see on a CAO Gold or Italia.The end clipped off cleanly, and the draw as I lit it was perfect. The initial puff was light, had some cedar to it, and was mild like what I would expect from a good Dominican. I took my time with the cigar, not rushing. The burn was steady, and the ash was light gray to white, dense, and even all the way around the cigar. No uneven burns.This cigar is similar to a Toro in length and ring size. It continued to smoke cool, becoming gradually more full as time went on. The character of the taste changed to become somewhat more spicy and peppery as the burn progressed. The taste stayed like this for the remainder of the cigar.The Medina is somewhat stronger than what I am used to smoking, but, I was able to smoke it down to the last inch of the stub, comfortably. I buzzed a little from the nicotine, but there was no harshness to the smoke at all.

I did have one that wouldn\u2019t draw but you can run into that once and a while with any brand. This isn\u2019t a top of the line cigar but it is a good quality smoke especially when you take its price tag into consideration. These robustos come in around $2 a stick retail, lower if you nab a box off of Cigarbid. That makes it a great cigar for the price conscious like me. They have a nice mellow flavor that doesn\u2019t hang around past its welcome.

Recently they have had two very successful and very well received lines of cigars and they are not flavored or infused in any way.  They are traditional cigars and they are sold under the name Liga Privada.  First came the No. 9 and most recently the T52 which a lot of cigar smokers are raving about.  Not that long ago I was able to smoke and review a pre-production version of the T52.  Specifically \u201cblend #3\u2033 which was supposedly selected as the final blend for what would become the production version of the T52.  Now I have heard second and third hand, that Drew Estate actually tweaked that final blend a bit at the last minute using a hybrid of the pre-production blends #3 and #4. I have no idea how accurate that is if at all but I heard it said often enough that I thought it worth mentioning.Since I smoked that pre-production version of the T52 I have been looking forward to revisiting the smoke in its final off the shelf incarnation.  I was very surprised by that first T52 and thought it to be a stellar cigar.  You can read my review of it by clicking here.  One of the unique features of this cigar is it\u2019s wrapper.   It is a one of kind wrapper leaf not used on any other cigar.  It is grown in Connecticut and it is harvested in a unique fashion.  You can read all about it in that review of the pre-production stick.Visually this cigar is just as beautiful as the pre-production version.  Dark and oily, and virtually flawless.  This one was a little different in the flavor department though, and that is not a bad thing.  This T52 starts off with very full and robust meaty flavors.  You feel like you just sat down and began eating a four course meal.  It was wonderful, but I knew if it kept up for the entire smoke it would be too much.  Thankfully it calmed down a bit after the first inch or two.  Then I was treated to rich and decadent notes of chocolate and espresso with the occasional flash of licorice.   I don\u2019t recall ever smoking a cigar with such a distinct chocolaty flavor to it.  It would switch back and forth between the thick meaty flavors and the slightly lighter chocolate and espresso.  Towards the end it became very full and robust again with a bit of black pepper on the finish.  I smoked this one down to the nub.  Construction was absolute perfection.  Perfect burn, perfect draw, perfect ash.  I don\u2019t think you could construct a cigar any better than this. I have to say I enjoyed the T52 immensely and found it to be even better than I remember the pre-production blend #3 to be.  This is a must try for any lover of stout, full bodied cigars.  It has earned a spot on my \u201cMatt\u2019s Favs\u201d list.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

The cigar that is being reviewed, however, is one of the old Miami lines. I believe that this one was still manufactured in Miami USA but I might be wrong. Needless to say, it has some age on it.The pre-light experience for my Padilla Miami Lancero was very pleasing.  The wrapper was golden brown, carrying veins with an oily sheen.  I found a small crack in the wrapper leaf near the top of the cigar.  The wonderful triple seam, pigtail cap was pleasing to the eye and the band was odd shaped with black, red, and gold lettering.  Pre-light smell showed light white pepper and cream.  The cold draw tickled my palate with notes of sweet fruit and showed perfect resistance.The first 1/3 of my Padilla Miami Lancero was nice and creamy with signs of toasted nuts.  This cigar produced loads and loads of smoke from the smallest draw, however the burn was a little uneven.  The ash was a wonderful snow white and the cigar seemed to be burning rather fast.The second third of the cigar showed woody signs paired with black cherry.  The transition of the flavors was amazing offering my palate just what it needed at that moment.  This cigar had lots of complexity and character and before beginning the last third, tastes of cedar and spice were pleasantly noted.  The burn, however, remained uneven and wavy.On the last third the taste turned very spicy, bold, and tart on the palate.  Also, the wrapper started to unravel, which is kind of a bummer, considering how great this cigar had been thus far.  My final thoughts of the Padilla Miami prove it to be a very nice lancero with lots of complexity and flavor.  This cigar did burn faster than normal however every puff was enjoyable.Pre-light: 9pts.

The double cap squarely mounted and cuts cleanly with my Colibri Monza Punch Cutter.The Oscuro wrapper gives off a gentle scent of earth and wood, while the foot lends a spicy sweetness. The cold draw is a bit tight but produces plenty of peppery flavors. The flavor profile is delicious and well-balanced from the first few puffs to the last. The Fallen Angel produces evenly matched flavors of wet earth, rich tobacco, leather, dark cocoa and oats. Some coffee undertones develop in the second third along with a natural sweetness.The Fallen Angel Robusto draws perfectly and produces huge plumes of thick, white smoke with each puff. The beautiful gray ash is strong and compact, growing to two inches before the first drop. The ash drops a total of three times during the smoking time. The burn is impeccably even but quick, with a total smoking time of forty-five minutes.A.J. Fernandez never ceases to amaze me.

I open the mailbox just to get \u201csmacked\u201d by a fine Brother of the Leaf over at The Herf Hut Cigar Forum. It came out of the clear blue sky. I was a victim of a sneak attack by Smokinson. In this random act of generosity was a selection of excellent smokes, two of which jumped out at me immediately.In the package were two very nicely aged Oliva cigars. The Oliva \u201cO\u201d cigars underwent a sort of re-branding a few years back.  It is now called the Serie O and the band and packaging has been completely redone.  Smokinson sent me two of the old \u201cO\u201d cigars, one of the Bold, and one Maduro from back before the re-branding.  Originally released in 2001 the Oliva \u201cO\u201d cigars were renowned for their presentation as well as for being a quality cigar.  They were very unique because thye sported embroidered velvet bands rather than the traditional paper bands, and the boxes were unusually shaped as well, close resembling of all things, a toilet seat.  It is hard to find much detail on these  cigars at this point as it has been several years since this version of the \u201cO\u201d has been made.  Because of the age and the fact they are no longer made, this \u201cO\u201d Bold is a special treat and a very generous gift.  So I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Smokinson for his generosity and for sharing these cigars with me.  The \u201cO\u201d Bold that I am smoking today is a Nicaraguan Puro.  I am a very big fan of Nicaraguan cigars so I am looking forward to lighting this one up.The wrapper is a dark, mottled brown and it seems to be very well filled.  The embroidered band makes for a very nice presentation.  The first few draws were very full and peppery.  It mellows out right away settling into a nice flavorful medium bodied smoke.  It has a classic Nicaraguan flavor, a strong core of toasted tobacco with some coffee notes.  It is surprisingly smooth yet still robust and a little chewy, signs of a well aged cigar.  It produces thick clouds of white smoke and the draw is absolutely sublime.  The draw could not be any better for me.  I noticed one odd characteristic of this smoke.  It produced a kind of numbing effect in my mouth.  Almost like a menthol feel but there was nothing in the flavor or aroma that was even remotely \u201cmenthol like\u201d.  It was odd but not really bothersome.  At the halfway mark it developed strong leather flavors with just a hint of nuts layer over a consistent core of toasted tobacco.  The last third is all pepper and tobacco.  It maintains its smoothness and chewiness through the entire smoke, again a hallmark of a well aged stogie.  The \u201cO\u201d Bold is a fantastic medium to full bodied smoke.  A classic Nicaraguan through and through.  It is a shame they discontinued this smoke.  I wonder when I smoke a cigar like this, that is clearly a very good cigar, why manufacturers discontinue them rather than sticking with a winner.  Maybe it\u2019s just that they don\u2019t have the tobacco for it anymore. Either way it is a shame these aren\u2019t made any more.  This is a solid smoke that has aged very well.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The Tatuaje brand is the marca responsible for Pepin Garcia\u2019s big breakout to fame in the cigar industry.  Now the man makes an impressive number of cigar lines for an array of different cigar marcas.  Most every cigar he puts out is received with praise and excitement, but the original Brown Label Tatuajes and their premium extension the Reservas are still the best cigars Pepin makes in my opinion.  I have talked before about the meaning behind the names that Pete Johnson gives to his cigars.  The meaning behind the J21 on this cigar seems to be a bit more cryptic.  I have seen a number of explanations for this moniker, from 21 being Pete\u2019s favorite number or 21 being the number of people in his family.  Whatever the 21 stands for it seem that most agree the \u201cJ\u201d is for Johnson.The Tatuaje Reserva J21 looks very different in comparison to the other cigars in the Reserva line of Tatuajes.  The wrapper on the J21 is much darker and rougher in appearance than the wrapper on the Reserva SW or the \u201cA\u201d Uno.  The wrapper is much lighter, smoother looking on those other Tatuaje Reservas.  This is because the other two Reservas use a lower priming (visio) for the wrapper where the J21 uses the highest priming (ligero).  The extra exposure to sun and elements makes for a darker rougher leaf.  It also produces a more robusto and potent leaf.  Pete uses a ligero wrapper on the Tatuaje Cojonu cigars too which are the strongest and most robust cigars in the Tatuaje line.  This is intriguing because the Cojonu is blended to be a very strong cigar where the Reserva line, in the case of the SW and the \u201cA\u201d Uno, tend to be the mildest (but by no means mild) of the Tatuaje lines.  So here with the J21 you have what I am assuming is the refined and elegant blend of the Reservas with the wrapper of the brash, robust Cojonus.  I imagine the two must meld together for a very unique experience for a Tatuaje.  I can hardly wait, so it\u2019s time to spark this robusto up.  I\u2019m using the \u201cThree Match Method\u201d on this one.The first third smoked just like a Cojonu.  Lots of black pepper and strong wood.  It was very robust and brash.  The second third was a bit more dynamic changing as the smoke progressed.  It mellowed out a bit like the cigar was trying to let me know it was a Reserva.  It was still much more full bodied that the other two sizes in the Reserva line.  The flavors were still predominately woody with a slight sweetness that was unlike anything I\u2019ve tasted in a Tatuaje.  As I passed the halfway mark the flavors became more dry with notes of leather and toasted tobacco and a slightly earthy finish.  In the last third it began to pick up again and the black pepper returned.The J21 is an excellent smoke that to me resembled a Cojonu more than it did a Reserva only it didn\u2019t have as strong a nicotine buzz as the Cojonus tend to have.  It is a full bodied and robust smoke with decent complexity and excellent flavors.  The burn was a bit odd on this smoke.  It meandered a lot never really burning straight but always managing to even itself out before requiring a flame to touch it up.  As thin and delicate as the corojo wrapper leaf is, you\u2019d think it wouldn\u2019t have a problem burning straight, but odd burns seem to be fairly common with corojo wrapped cigars in my experience.  I\u2019d recommend this cigar to any Tatuaje fan.  You won\u2019t be disappointed.  If you like the bold in your face flavor of a Cojonu but would like it in a smaller format, the Reserva J21 will satisfy your craving.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It is their first full-bodied release and while not a true maduro cigar,  they tell me they obtained the oscuro color and full-bodied flavor profile by applying a new proprietary method of trabajando to the aged ligero leaves used to make it.  What was told to me by a representative was that the method is a company secret but try to imagine an overly ripe banana...  It comes in several parejo vitollas: L200 - 40 x 4 7/8, L250 - 48 x 5 3/4, L300 - 50 x 5 3/4, L400 - 54 x 5 3/4, L500 - 60 x 5 3/4, and one they call the Mysterio which is a figurado.The Cabinet Oscuro is made with an Ecuadorian Sumatra wrapper, and Dominican binder and fillers from their own farm in La Canela, Dominican Republic.  It has a beautiful, shiny, oily wrapper (in fact probably one of the oiliest you will encounter), with nice texture and teeth.  It squeezed well, had no soft spots, and was obviously well packed.  It has a very enjoyable, sweet pre-light aroma that changes slightly as you go from head to foot and is more pronounced at the open foot.  I made a punch-cut and tested the draw which was smooth and easy and left a very mild, earthy tobacco taste on the lips and tongue.  After lighting, the flavor starts out with a very mild spice on the tip of the tongue which slowly begins to build.  It produces a grey, \"stringy\" smoke that looks like it is slowly pulling apart as it floats away.  As it burns it leaves behind a light-grey ash with dark undertones and highlights which flakes a bit, but otherwise holds on pretty well.  Retro-exhalation is pretty easy until you are near the very end and leaves pepper notes in the sinuses.  As the flavor profile develops, it becomes a little peppery which can be felt on the tongue and holds on throughout.  The pepper picks up some just past the half-way point but never becomes overwhelming and maintains a noticeable balance and consistency all the way to the dry, mild-spice finish.The La Flor - Ligero Cabinet Oscuro is one of my favorite choices when the time and mood is right.  While it is upper-medium to full-bodied, it is not overly strong but definitely has enough to bring on the leading edge of a buzz so you should certainly eat first.  One thing to be aware of is that every one I have ever smoked required a fair amount of touching up and even re-lighting.  I don't think this is a quality issue like with some cigars, I sort of attribute it to being a side effect of the heavy oiliness of the wrapper which is a good thing.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/images/cigar/lfd-ligero.png"}, "cortez robusto": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Robusto Size : 5 x 50 Wrapper : Brazilian Maduro Binder :  Dominican Filler : Dominican Hand-Made Price : ~$5 each", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "cortez", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/cortez/cortez-robusto", "full review": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Robusto Size : 5 x 50 Wrapper : Brazilian Maduro Binder :  Dominican Filler : Dominican Hand-Made Price : ~$5 eachUnfortunately, I have none. I picked this cigar up from a shop I usually don\u2019t go to. The reason why I don\u2019t go to this cigar shop (that is literally walking distance from my house, a cigar smoker's dream) is because the owner is the most boring cigar smoker I have ever met. On top of that, he knows nothing about what he is selling, and no surprise, he knows nothing about this cigar. That is why I go out of my way and 20 minutes away from my house to Leesburg Cigars & Pipes.It\u2019s Monday, almost evening and I'm getting some homework done before I see the Deadskins vs the Queer-gles play on Monday Night Football. I am sitting next to the colors of fall in front of this tree, and honestly, it\u2019s a great start to an evening. Before I keep going on, with my fake poetic self, let me stop. And enough about me, let\u2019s talk about this cigar I have never even heard of.Now this is going to be pretty simple to explain, yet it\u2019s very weird. This cigar taste likes sweet veggies mixed with a light maduro flavor profile. Honestly, while I think most cigar smokers (especially full body cigar smokers) won't like this cigar, I actually really enjoy it. See, it still has the softness of a mild-to-medium body cigar that I like, but with plenty of maduro characteristics, which I also like. And at this price point, I can definitely see me smoking a lot of these.Looking at the Cortez Cigars website, which looks like it just got hit by Hurricane Ugly, I managed to find out that the wrapper is a Brazilian Maduro. No wonder I enjoy this cigar! I feel like you can mix any other country, and as long as it has some Brazilian tobacco, you\u2019re going to get a pretty good cigar.You know what, this cigar is a winner in my book. Excellent quality, construction, burn and consistency in flavor. Again, it's not the most amazing cigar when it comes to flavor, but with everything else going perfect, this cigar is truly a bang for your buck. And definitely could fit in your daily cigar humidor section.If you have a similar palate to mine, in which you enjoy mild to medium bodied cigars, but also enjoy the maduro characteristics, this is the ideal cigar for you. All you tough guys who enjoy the full body cigar, stay away because you will not like the Cortez.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

JohnLongIsland is a first class brother of the leaf and a 1st class individual as well.  John is a big supporter of my fundraising efforts for the Ride for Kids and his generosity is always very much appreciated.  He sent me a little gift a short while back that included this fine cigar.  Thanks John.It seems to be a trend that has developed over the last year or so.  A cigar comes out and it is proclaimed as a private blend created just for the owner of the brand, or as a \u201cpersonal blend\u201d made for someone high ranking officer in the company, and now for the first time it is going to be made available to the public.  The Tatuaje Black Label is probably the highest profile example of one of these \u201cprivate cigars made public\u201d.This one was supposedly made for Steve Saka of Drew Estate and was intended to be a strictly private stock cigar.  The \u201cNo. 9\u2033 supposedly denotes that this cigar was the 9th blend in a series of prototypes made when creating this cigar.  I have no idea how or why it became available for public sale.  Truth or hype, I leave it to you to decide if you care to do so.  Truth is, it is kind of irrelevant in the end.  What matters is\u2026 Is it any good?If nothing else, this cigar is beautiful to behold much like its newer brother, the soon to be released Liga Privada T52.  The wrapper has a naturally dark brown appearance with a silky, oily sheen.  It is toothy,  a little bumpy, and veiny, but the wrapper is so perfectly applied and the cigar is so handsome you cannot call it rustic.  Say what you will about Drew Estate and their reputation among cigar purists, but they make some of the most visually beautiful cigars you can buy.  Speaking of their reputation, although known primarily for flavored and infused cigars, the Liga Privada is a traditional offering from Drew Estate.  It is not flavored or infused, and it doesn\u2019t use any non traditional tobacco like pipe tobaccos in its blend.  This is a straight-up stogie and an excellently constructed one at that.The Liga Privada No. 9 starts off smooth and rich with a nice meaty flavor.  It mellows a little once you get past the first inch or so.  At first I thought this cigar was going to be a full bodied smoke, but as it turns out it isn\u2019t quite that robust.  It is a solid medium bodied cigar that delivers nice flavors of chocolate and espresso with a little black pepper on the finish.  The construction could not be better with a perfect draw and a razor sharp burn.  The salt and pepper ash is very well formed and holds firm for more than an inch before needing to be tapped.Overall this is a really enjoyable smoke with some great, easily discernable flavors.  However, there isn\u2019t much complexity here.  Once it settles in after that first inch, the cigar never really changes again so it ends up being a bit of a one dimensional smoke.  Still, what it does deliver is quite good.  I think this cigar makes for an excellent social smoke when you are looking for a tasty smoke that you may not be giving your full attention, but when you want that smoke to be better than some yard \u2018gar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Bogdan (author and owner) was very kind to translate the review of the Maria Mancini Magic Mountain that was published on his website a little while ago.Humidor: Almost one year ago, I was reading \u201cThe Spell of a Vice\u201d on Lascaris\u2019 blog. In his article, Lascaris refers to Thomas Mann\u2019s \u201cThe Magic Mountain\u201d, where the main character, Hans Castrop abides by his habits, enjoying a cigar manufactured by Maria Mancini. As far as this cigar is concerned, reality and fiction mingle because the author uses the name of a real producer from Honduras - Maria Mancini, the only difference being that, in the novel, the cigar is located in Bremen. Maria Mancini settled the scores and, taking advantage of the novel\u2019s success, created a cigar called Magic Mountain.I liked Lascaris\u2019 article and Maria Mancini brand\u2019s idea of creating a cigar inspired by the novel. Consequently, I re-read the novel, paying special attention to the sections including cigar descriptions, which I had ignored upon the first lecture:\u201cThe first thing he needed after meals was the scented water bowl to wash his fingers, and the uncustomed Russian cigarette, which he gladly purchased from the black market, through rather illegal means. He smoked it before the cigar, a savory brand from Bremen, called Maria Mancini, to be mentioned later on and the poisonous flavor whereof so wonderfully mingled with that of coffee. Hans Castrop kept his tobacco ration away from the negative influence of the radiator, he kept it in the basement, where he was descending each morning to fill his port-cigarette with the daily share.\u201d", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/images/cigar/maria-mancini.jpg"}, "camacho corojo monarca": {"origin": "Origin : Honduras Format : Robusto Size : 127 x 20 mm Ring : 50 Wrapper : Honduras Filler : Honduras Binder : Honduras Hand-Made Price : ~$5 eachMore info about purchasing Camacho Corojo cigars...", "overall rating": " This Camacho is aimed at veteran smokers who are used to full-strength cigars.

The line consists of ten sizes that are all available in sun-grown natural and maduro wrappers and all the sizes are box pressed. All tobacco used in these cigars is reportedly aged for four years.  Due to the immense popularity of this line of cigars, it has become one of the most counterfeited non-Cuban cigars in the world. To help protect their brand and their customers Padr\u00f3n introduced a few security measures to make counterfeiting more difficult.  They added a specially designed double band featuring an individually numbered guarantee label. The back side of the labels is also printed.These are amazingly popular and highly sought after cigars.  Time and time again they receive stellar ratings in just about every cigar publication out there.  So as you can expect with high ratings, glowing reviews, and immense popularity comes a pretty hefty price tag as well.  The Diplomatico sells for around $15 a stick making this one of those smokes you reserve for a special occasion unless your last name is Gates, or Jobs, or something equally impressive.  Then maybe this is you everyday, after lunch cigar.  For the rest of us the Padr\u00f3n \u201964, or the PAM or PAN as the are commonly referred to, is a special treat.  Another side effect of the kind of popularity that this line of cigars enjoys is all the conjecture and rumor and debate that seems to swirl around it.  There are all kinds of wild theories out there regarding the makeup of this cigar, and they are all generally unsubstantiated.  One of the most popular is the rumor that this really isn\u2019t a Nicaraguan Puro, but that Mexican tobacco is used in the cigar.  I have heard it said that the wrapper is Mexican, or that the filler contains Mexican tobacco.  It seems there is no shortage of rumors about it, but no one ever has any proof or even a nameable source for the claims.  Anyway, I try to just ignore the wild speculation and I let my taste-buds to do all the judging for me.  I am mostly concerned about one thing.  Do I like it, or do I not like it?  There is an easy way to find out.  Now where\u2019s my lighter\u2026The PAM has a dark brown oily wrapper with a trademark sloppy Padr\u00f3n cap.  I don\u2019t know why but Padron torcedors seem to be incapable of applying a neat, good looking cap on a cigar.  Otherwise the construction on these cigars is impeccable.  It has a perfect draw with a perfect burn.  Smoking a PAM is like smoking a chocolate bar.  A chocolate core is complimented by smooth notes of earth and coffee.  It starts off a little mellow and picks up in robustness and strength as you make your way through the smoke.  In the last third it developed an amazing creamy and nutty finish.  It is a fantastic cigar from start to finish.  The Padr\u00f3n 1964 Anniversary never disappoints.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

In 2004, Padr\u00f3n released a stunning box-pressed torpedo named the Serie 1926 40th Anniversary. It garnered almost universal critical acclaim when it came out, but can this cigar hold up to its own mystique eight years later?After looking through the neglected corners of my humidor I happened across a box of maduro wrapped 40th Anniversary cigars from 2004. They have a wonderful aroma of dark chocolate delightfully balanced with cedar from the box. These eight year old cigars still have their distinct box press with a dark and slightly toothy wrapper. Like all Serie 1926 cigars, the construction is perfect with tight seams, an even bunch, and a gracefully tapered head.The 40th Anniversary is sweet and rich bursting with dusty cocoa, earth, espresso, and a hint of tea on the long finish. It is very smooth on the nose with subtle spices gently warming the palate. Midway through the cigar a pleasing note of roasted nuts materializes as the espresso fades. Of course, the cigar never became bitter. This is one of those special cigars that can seem both rich and bold while retaining a sense of refinement and finesse.At around $25 each, the 40th Anniversary is not a bargain; however, it represents a solid value with its bold delivery of flavor and perfect construction. This cigar showcases how masterful the blenders at Padr\u00f3n are, not only with the balance and complexity of the individual cigar, but also with the consistency these cigars provide from year to year. When you purchase a box of Padr\u00f3n Anniversary cigars you know that you\u2019re getting what you\u2019re expecting.Appearance/Structure \u2013 15/15 Smoking Characteristics \u2013 24/25 Flavor \u2013 24/25 Overall Impression \u2013 32/35Total - 95This post was written by Nathan.

My mission was to review the Tatuaje RC 184. As a member of The Cigar Spy agency, I promise to respect the A.S.H.E.S. code of honor.Tatuaje is the brainchild of Pete Johnson, who along with Jose \u201cDon Pepin\u201d Garcia rolls these cigars in Little Havana, Miami, Florida. They use first generation Cuban seed grown in Nicaragua. The RC stands for Retro Cuban and the 184 is the length in mm. It is one of the special blends for the Tatuaje Cabinet Series.Fall is definitely upon us. It is the middle of the afternoon and there is a little nip in the air. The sun is shining brightly and a little breeze is blowing. The leaves are starting to turn and it is a beautiful day to sit outside and have a cigar.The wrapper is chocolate in color, has a few veins, very firm from head to foot, and has the smell of hay and cedar.Today's pairing: some cold spring water!The initial draw on this Tat is a little tough, but after about a quarter inch or so, it starts drawing nicely. My initial impression after the first few puffs can be summed up in one word: FIERY! The spices in this cigar are leaving my palate feeling as though I just sucked down a couple habanero peppers. Along with the fire, I taste some definite roasted coffee and a hint of cocoa. I think I am gonna enjoy this ride. Our musical pairing today is some psychobilly compliments of Mad Sin. FTW indeed!As I get through the first third of the Tat, the burn has stayed even, the draw and finish are solid and the taste has taken a turn. The most prevalent taste is the roasted coffee. The spiciness of this bad boy has mellowed, it\u2019s still there on the retrohale, but by no means is it unpleasant. I can still taste a hint of cocoa, but am also getting a hint of wood. Staying with our psychobilly feel, we have moved onto The Battle of Ninjamanz! Japanese psychobilly at its best!Now we are over halfway through the RC184 and it is living up to its billing. The spiciness is next to nonexistent. It has really mellowed out into a smooth espresso and earth taste. The aroma reminds me of a campfire. Now, one place where the RC184 has kicked it up a notch is in the nicotine department. I am getting that nice, full belly, light head feeling. It is not overpowering or causing me the shakes, but it definitely has me buzzing nicely. This being the case, it could be why we have moved into the softer side of psychobilly, Tiger Army! Rise, Ghost Tigers, Rise!As we move into the final third of the Tatuaje RC 184, the burn has stayed even, the draw has been outstanding and the flavors have remained consistent. The cocoa has returned to add a little sweetness to the espresso and the fiery kick from earlier has come back to remind me that it is and always was there. The RC184 finishes strong and is almost becoming overpowering in terms of the nicotine kick. I may need to chug some water and lie down for a few minutes when this is over!The Tatuaje RC 184 lived up to my expectations. It was medium to full-bodied in power and the flavors were outstanding. If you are lucky enough to get your hands on one of these, give yourself some time (I spent a solid hour and 45 minutes on it) to really enjoy it. Pete Johnson is one of what I call the \u201crock stars\u201d of the cigar industry and usually does not disappoint!Photo credit: Vitolas.netThis post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

I truly understand why there isn\u2019t any other Canadian companies at this point, well and of course the absolute crazy tax structure the government has in place on tobacco products.\u201dMy hat is off to you, sir!  It seems like cigar companies always have interesting stories behind them, and Dominion is no exception.  Dominion seems like it\u2019s off to a great start with the Dominion Black Lotus.  The Black Lotus is blended out of Honduran and Nicaraguan tobacco, and manufactured in Danli, Honduras.  Ralph Montero of Alec Bradley had a hand in putting together this blend.I was sent a couple of different sizes, the Toro and the Gordo, as well as a very nice complimentary ashtray. For this review I smoked the Toro since I'm more comfortable with this format than the 60-ring gauge Gordo.Steve generously provided a beautiful Dominion ashtray along with two cigars to give away to one of our readers.

Don't forget to subscribe to our newsletter so you don't miss the winner announcement and other contests (there are more giveaways coming up in the next weeks!).Appearance :  The wrapper is a mottled medium brown with a bit of tooth and an oily sheen.  There\u2019s a nice double cap, and only a few fine veins.  It feels quite firm, almost too firm, which has me a little bit anxious about the draw.  The brand is a beautiful, eye-catching gold and blue design with the Black Lotus icon.  The pre-light aroma is musty and earthy with a hint of sweet hay.Construction :  What a pleasant surprise.  The first draw is just fine, and none of the other draws feel tight either.  Construction is beautiful all around with a razor sharp burn and very little need for touch-ups.  The ash builds up and hangs on.  There are literally no flaws except that I needed to relight the cigar in the end of the second third.Flavor :  (4.25) The flavors are creamy, spicy, and peppery, all nicely balanced.  At times the pepper is intense, but never overkill.  During the middle third, the flavors transition with the spice dropping down substantially.  I keep expecting those earthy notes I smelled on pre-light to come through, but they don\u2019t, though the sweet hay is there, woven in with the rest in a very well-melded way.  The flavors become salty and there is a hint of anise\u2014but also something sour, and not in a good way like tasty citrus\u2014just sour and unpleasant.  Thankfully this is a brief phase before the cigar morphs back into more pleasant territory.  The earthiness finally comes through in the last third, and the nuts take front and center stage.  The spiciness is still there, but it\u2019s way in the background now.Overall Rating :  I can\u2019t say anything yet about the value of this cigar, since I don\u2019t know what it will be retailing at.  You can purchase it at select retailers in Canada right now (it was released in October 2014), but you still can\u2019t buy it anywhere else.  It is expected to hit stores in Germany early next year, and release later in 2015 in the United States.  I will be interested to see what it sells for; it\u2019s certainly a delightful stogie and I look forward to my chance to smoke another.  Aside from that brief sour interlude in the middle third (which may have been a fluke), this is a pretty good cigar.  Complex flavors, beautiful construction, and a promising foray into the cigar world by a new Canadian brand.  Definitely try one of these if you get a chance!This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

It has been a long time since we, The Tollaficionados have set forth our opinions on some of the fine smokes available on the market today.  Busy \u2013 Busy, and we apologize.  But fear not, though the qualities of said smokes (or lack thereof) have not been etched into the walls of time by us as of late, we have in fact kept up on the goings-on of the industry and have made plenty of time to enjoy lots of smokes together.Our return at this time was spurred on for 2 reasons:  1) It gave Father & Son some more bonding time (and on Super Bowl Sunday to boot!), 2) The cigar that we chose to enjoy is the Montecristo New York Connoisseur Edition, only recently available through brick & mortar shops in the fine state in which we reside.So our tale begins with its construction.  This $14 stick has an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper concealing a Nicaraguan binder and Dominican filler.  It is only available in one size, a corona gorda, measuring 6 inches with a 60 ring gauge and it is box pressed.  Now I am sure that there are many of you out there who, as I, are not fans of box pressing.  I have never had a cigar in which it lent it anything extra, other that an eventually soft butt which craps out specks of tobacco.  This is not the case with this cigar.  Though I couldn\u2019t tell you whether the shape adds anything to the experience (because it is the only shape/size that is made), I can say that the box pressed end was not a detractor due to the 60 ring gauge size.  It rounded out well during the smoke and didn\u2019t loose tobacco.This Montecristo had a beautiful appearance, with its maple colored wrapper, lightly veined leaf and impressive art on the band.  (Yes, We liked the band \u2013 so what?)  The cap was incredibly sturdy and thick.  Being that we used a bullet/plug cutter, it made for a very impressive look into the thickness of the cap and the integrity of its construction.After toasting the foot and lighting `er up, both taste and aroma were released that were very pleasing.  For about the first inch of its length, the cigar had a steady build in flavor.  Its more mild characteristics being traded for flavors that lingered a little longer on the palate.  This profile held until about halfway when it dropped off to its original mildness, and then went through the same progression a second time.  Its finish was long and gave off a bit of sweetness.  My favorite cigars are bold, and Dad has a liking for a mild profile, and overall we agreed that this cigar, regardless of what you may hear elsewhere falls on the mild side of medium bodied.  Through the entire smoke the cigar remained firm and burned evenly, though there was some wrapper cracking due to the removing of the double labels and the abundance of vegetable gum that was used to put them on.  However, it did not affect the smoking of the cigars.The smoke was very enjoyable from light to finish, and was definitely one that enhanced the conversation as it was brought down to the nub.  The Montecristo New York Connoisseur Edition is without question the best non-Cuban Montecristo on the market, and also takes the prize for being the best New York edition smoke.  (We have had them all: Alec Bradley, La Aurora, Gurkha.)  Now, is it worthy of its $14 price point?  No.  This is an $8 to possibly $11 cigar.  But that is it.  It is definitely enjoyable, has all of the positives that one would expect from this flagship brand, but does it stand out when looking at the big picture of what is available in that price range?  It does not.  This cigar will sell well to the many that are curious over this extension to a well established brand.  But continuity sales will not be something that Montecristo will be boasting about.We look forward to reviewing another cigar for you very soon, and here\u2019s wishing a long ash to you all!

I would have done a review on another LFD cigar but for the most part I don\u2019t care for them all that much. So I was extremely surprised to hear from Todd Dailey, at Good Karma Cigar highly recommend to me this LFD Cabinet Maduro. I told him I didn\u2019t care much for maduros and didn\u2019t really like a lot of the LFD\u2019s outside of the Litto Gomez lines.

The dark chocolate-brown colored wrapper is flecked with some small, puckered veins and is left long to cover the foot. The simple, mustard colored band is in line with the un-refined vibe of the cigar. Beneath the Connecticut Broadleaf is a Mexican San Andres Negro binder snuggly wrapped around long fillers grown in Esteli and Jalapa. The cap is thin but nicely mounted and pulled into a taught pigtail. It cuts cleanly using the punch cutter on my Colibri Evoke Lighter.The pre-light aroma is dark and earthy with notes of barnyard and cocoa. The cold draw is easy and gives off a gentle cocoa flavor. Once lit, the first few puffs are full of woodsy notes with a strong tobacco base. Hints of wheat and crushed black peppercorn appear midway through the first third. The second third starts off with more dark, earthy flavors but soon develops a gentle sweetness and a leathery finish. The final third is dominated by leather, rich tobacco, and smoked hickory.Drew Estate\u2019s Nica Rustica draws perfectly and produces ample smoke with each puff. Despite the extremely windy conditions, the crisp, white ash grows to nearly two inches before the first drop.  The burn is quickened by the wind, but the burn line remains even. The ash drops a total of three times during the seventy-five minute smoke.The Nica Rustica is a great addition to Drew Estate\u2019s line of impressive sticks. It is beautifully constructed and burns flawlessly. The flavor is rich and complex.

A few medium sized veins are present but do not detract from the cigar in a meaningful way. The band has a very contemporary design.From the beginning the Fausto is full bodied with dark and rich flavors. The cigar immediately opens with a cacophony of spice and leather that lacks balance. An inch into the cigar the flavors become more harmonious, revealing additional notes of earth, wood, and dark chocolate with a long finish. The texture of the smoke is dense and almost chewy. Midway into the cigar the chocolate flavor shifts to a more pronounced espresso. The Fausto is nothing short of a full-bodied, full strength cigar. The abundance of thick and oily tobacco required for this blend does not inhibit a nearly perfect burn.The FT153 is neither elegant nor subtle \u2013 it is powerful and concentrated, but the flavors are sharp and sometimes become lost in the strength.

Known mostly for flavored and infused cigars, when Drew Estate ventures into more traditional lines of cigars it always raises some eyebrows and draws attention.  Their Liga Privada line of cigars seems to be their best received offering of traditional smokes.  The T-52 is a new cigar in the line that hasn\u2019t even been released yet.  It is set to be released at this year's IPCPR convention.  T.G., a very generous brother at The Herf Hut Cigar Forum, offered to share one of these new cigars that he was lucky enough to get his hands on a little early.  Thanks T.G., I really appreciate it.The really special thing about this new cigar is the wrapper.  It is a new, never used before and exclusive wrapper that the folks at Drew Estate have dubbed \u201cStalk Cut Habano\u201d.  Rather that trying to tell the story myself I\u2019ll just quote the information that T.G. sent me that he got from Jonathan Drew.  In this explanation the wrapper is referred to as American Habano, but apparently they have changed their minds and decided to refer to it as Stalk Cut Habano.  Read on\u2026 The history of the \u201cLiga Privada T-52\u2033 begins three and a half years ago when Steve Saka joined Drew Estate. Just at that time, Nick Melillo, Steve Saka and I were heading back and forth to Brazil and Dominican Republic working with certain well known growers to obtain a wrapper that was heavy and clean that could be grown excusively for Drew Estate.While we saw some amazing Brazillian Habano and Dominican Corojo wrappers, we had not yet made up our minds to move forward with the purchase, as we were looking at a half million dollar investment, and wanted a certain taste profile and dark brown, rich appearance. We were, however, very impressed by both of these wrappers.Then it happened \u2026On a regular farm trip to Connecticut for the purposes of purchasing a barn of Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro with Universal Leaf Company (Lancaster Leaf), we stumbled upon a farm that was growning a very unique looking \u201cStalk Cut Tobacco\u201d in addition to the Broadleaf. This American farmer (whose name I will reveal once the brand is released at the RTDA show this summer) called the wrapper leaf \u2013 \u201cAmerican Habano.\u201d After a few hours of inspection, we were impressed, but we tried to keep our composure, as this beautiful leaf had the exact color and thickness qualities that we had been flying all over the damn world looking for. Over and over, I kept making hand motions to Saka to stop smiling and looking so darn excited. It was difficult, cause he\u2019s just that kind of guy\u2026 Lucky for us, the farmer was complaining that this experimental tobacco would be the last year of crop unless he found a buyer who was willing to look past this one crop and make a real committment. He said that other brokers had loved the tobacco, but they didn't want to pay the high price which is required to grow it the right way.In any event, we took a break for lunch and he treated us to a hamburger at a true American small town diner. During lunch, Saka and I could barely eat (just imagine that), with our complete attention on burning the hell out of that \u201cAmerican Habano\u201d for combustion and flavor. Needless to say, we made our first purchase by the next morning and called the bank in Nicaragua preparing them for the good or bad news, depending on which side you\u2019re looking at. We spent a pretty penny\u2026!We were excited and nervous, cause we still had to remove all the tobacco from the barn, ship it to Nicaragua, and place it in Pilones for curing. This wrapper is no joke. Thick and oily, and dark redish brown \u2013 we had no idea where the bulk would take this stuff. Well, almost three years later it finally, finally burned. Saka still had a job (just jokin \u2026 well), and I still had a bank. And together, we made one of the very finest investments in the history of Drew Estate. Welcome \u201cLiga Privada T-52.\u201d Welcome \u201cAmerican Habano\u201d Wrapper.And please remember, there is more to the story \u2013 Filler and Binder - which has a story of its own yet to come \u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013(When I asked for confirmation that stalk cutting was what I thought it meant):Regular Tobacco Picking is when the tobacco is picked from the field, starting at the bottom of the plant and then moving up (over a number of weeks), then put into little hands of tobacco and hung in the barn. Stalk Cut is when the entire stalk is cut and removed from the farm, then hung to dry by the stalk in the barn. Broadleaf is the only Stalk Cut tobacco that I believe Drew Estate purchases. I do not know of any other tobaccos that are stalk cut at all.(When I inquired as to why the stalk cut):1. Stalk Cutting has been out of fashion and basically no one does it anymore for many many years. This is because only the leaves at the bottom hit their full potential and it makes the cost of the tobacco go way up \u2013 less money for farmer.2. Saka gave special instructions to this Farmer in Ct to Stalk Cut the tobacco, so this is an incredibly rare process these days.3. Why Stalk Cut \u2013 By Spear Stalking in the curing brand and hanging the entire stalk, the tobacco retains its natural oils, sap and nutrients and becomes a richer, more flavorful and oily leaf.I wish I had more information about the filler and binder but like it says above, that information is \u201cyet to come\u201d.A unique thing about this being a pre-release sample is the cigar band.  It is hand written on the back side of an old La Vieja Habana band that I have never seen before.  Click the pictures below to see enlarged views of the band.  I was not sure what the \u201c_3\u2033 means after the T52, but below is the date of March 23rd, 2009.  Don\u2019t know if that is the date it was rolled, or the date it was banded but either way it\u2019s pretty cool.  A quick Google search revealed for me what that number 3 means.  I saw one of Jonathan Drew\u2019s tweets in which he states \u201cSmoking the 2 Different Final Blends for the new Liga Privada T52 Toro for August release. Very tasty \u2013 the #3 seems best.\u201d I am assuming the number 3 blend is the final choice for this cigar since they seem to be handing them out to consumers, but I could not find confirmation of that.  I also have no idea that the actual band for this line will look like but it will probably be similar is some way to the Liga Privada No. 9 band if I had to guess, and that\u2019s all that is\u2026 a guess.The Stalk-Cut Habano wrapper is very dark and very oily.  It almost feels slippery there is so much oil on this leaf.  There are several prominent veins running all over its surface and it looks a little leathery giving it an overall rustic look and feel.  It is topped with a large cap that clipped off a little sloppily.  It has an aroma that is slightly sweet and a little musty like a maduro cigar.  A test draw reveals a nice pull with just a little resistance.  Outwardly this appears to be a very nicely constructed cigar.The first thing that jumps out at you upon lighting this cigar is the incredible amount of smoke it produces.  Thick billowing clouds of white smoke fill the air.  It starts off very smooth will full on cocoa and leathery notes with a slightly sweet finish.  The draw is absolutely flawless and I cannot stop staring at this wrapper.  It is absolutely gorgeous and is oily beyond belief.  The burn is slow and cool.  It is a little jagged but stays even and doesn\u2019t require any attention.  The cigar fills the air with a rich and slightly sweet aroma that is wonderful and heady.  The T52 starts off amazingly well.About a third of the way through it mellows out a bit.  Cocoa is still the dominate flavor and there is a little bit of pepper that starts to come through.  The cocoa dominates this smoke the entire way complimented by notes of leather, coffee bean, and pepper.  It picks up a bit towards the end becoming a bit more robust and the pepper notes get stronger.  It is a very good medium bodied smoke with excellent flavors, smooth from start to finish.I have to admit whenever I have a cigar by Drew Estate I approach it with a bit of scepticism.  They are so strongly associated with infused and flavored cigars which are something I just don\u2019t enjoy.  I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect here; I never had a Liga Privada No. 9.  Well I was very pleasantly surprised. The Liga Privada T52 is a strong entry into the relam of traditional cigars.  I really enjoyed this cigar and will definitely smoke this one again.  I look forward to its release.  One of the most striking things about this cigar is the wrapper.  It is an absolutely beautiful leaf and it makes an excellent and unique wrapper.  I recommend you give this one a try when you get the opportunity.  It is a great smoke from beginning to end.  I would love to see more cigars like this from Drew Estate.  I plan to try the No. 9 very soon (update: you can read my review here).This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

This cigar has taken the industry by storm receiving glowing reviews from enthusiasts and professionals alike, even scoring a 94 in Cigar Aficionado (the vitola that got a 94 was the torpedo; the double robusto scored a 92).Serie V is a complex blend of Nicaraguan long filler tobaccos. Blended with specially fermented Jalapa Valley ligero, and finished with a high priming Habano Sun Grown Wrapper.Blending Notes: This cigar is blended to deliver full body taste while maintaining an unparalleled smoothness. This flavorful blend exhibits complex tobacco with rich coffee and dark chocolate tones. A subtle and well balanced spice is present throughout.Today I\u2019m smoking what Oliva is calling a Double Robusto, but I\u2019m not sure why they don\u2019t just call it a Robusto. I guess you might say the 54 ring gauge is a bit big for a robusto which more commonly measure in at 50 or 52 and that could be the justification for it, but to me it\u2019s just a Robusto. The whole idea of a double robusto is silly to me but before I get too side tracked let's get back to this cigar.The wrapper is a beautiful rich brown and it is smooth and oily looking with only a few small veins running through it. The cap really catches your attention. It\u2019s huge, covering almost a full half inch of the cigar and it looks like a 4 seam cap winding its way up the head. Here\u2019s a picture (click to enlarge):The monster cap on this beefy cigar clipped nicely with my Palio. There was no evidence of any rib veins anywhere is the thick head or foot. The bunch of the filler looks perfect and the cigar is well filled, firm on its entire length with no soft spots. Sometimes these large ring gauges can be tricky to get a good even light on but this one took the flame nicely. The well executed light made for a nice even burn right from the start.This cigar is very smooth and refined. It started off with a classic tobacco flavor with cocoa notes. The finish is smooth with a subtle sweetness. I have heard a lot of talk of how this is a robust full bodied cigar but I just wasn\u2019t getting that. It is on the fuller side of medium, but I\u2019d still describe it as a medium bodied smoke. At about the halfway point the flavors change a little. The tobacco flavor is still dominate but it gets more earthy with some pepper and it maintains that cocoa undertone. It also split a bit vertically and the wrapper also cracked horizontally around the diameter of the cigar right next to the vertical split. It still held together though and smoked fine. I talked to some who had this cigar literally blow up and unravel on them so I guess I was lucky it wasn\u2019t worse that it was. The issues were not caused by the band which came off the cigar perfectly without damaging the wrapper at all.I found this to be a very enjoyable cigar and liked it more than any other Oliva I\u2019ve tried since the original Master Blends. It didn\u2019t live up to the hype on strength but the flavors were really good so that fact didn\u2019t detract from my enjoyment of the cigar. Unless the vitolas are that drastically different, I just don\u2019t agree with the exceptional 94 rating CA gives the Serie V. It is certainly a good cigar but I would expect more, especially in the construction department from a cigar that rates that high. I look forward to trying some of the other vitolas because I\u2019ve seen some glowing reviews of them, particularly the Figuardo and the Lancero. I am rating this cigar a B+ even given the minor construction issues because flavor wise this was a really good cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The wrapper leaf is the color of dark chocolate and flecked with a few veins. An ornate purple, silver, and gold band is the perfect accent to the stunning wrapper leaf. The length of the five-inch stick is mostly plump with a few noticeable soft spots. The cap is thick and neatly mounted. It cuts cleanly with my Colibri V Cutter.The San Andres Maduro leaf gives off the distinct aroma of milk weed blossoms while the foot smells of black cherries. The cold draw is easy and produces light flavors of barley and black pepper.  Once lit, the initial few puffs are incredibly bitter and acrid with a strong aroma of ammonia. However, these flavors dissipate quickly. The flavor profile changes to a strong, earthy base with hints of cocoa and espresso. A leathery undertone develops towards the end of the first third along with a bit of anise on the back of the palate. Dark, earthy flavors of leather, cocoa, and wood dominate the second third. The final third sees a surge of smoked hickory along with the ever-present cocoa and leather.The Alec Bradley Tempus Maduro draws nicely and produces tons of rich, flavorful smoke. The ash is a light gray color with a tawny tinge to it. The strong, compact ash grows to about an inch and a half before the first drop. The burn line remains perfectly even up until the final third, during which the burn canoes \u00be\u201d up the side of the wrapper. The smoke production decreases in the final third and the burn becomes very hot but is easily fixed by a couple of quick purges. The ash drops a total of three times during the hour-long smoke.Alec Bradley\u2019s Tempus Maduro is a great follow up to the original Tempus. It is full strength and full flavor with a delightful complexity. It made for a great after dinner stick. I think six months of aging would do wonders for it and hopefully remove the bitterness from the first few puffs.Article by Kayla, a cigar aficionada from Florida who also writes for CheapHumidors.com.

Avelino Lara is better known as the former personal cigar roller to Fidel Castro and the man responsible for the creation of the Cuban Cohiba brand.This cigar was named in honor of the first building located where the restaurant and wine collection are located today. It is estimated that this first building was one of the first structures developed for the city of Nassau.I found this cigar by simple accident and chance, rummaging through my secondary humidor containing a large cache of various cigars purchased from a family member. Buried somewhere near the bottom is where I came upon the Graycliff 1666. Not having had the opportunity to smoke any of these cigars in the past, I felt this would be a nice candidate for immediate interrogation.Appearance-wise for this cigar, I found a couple of small chips in the veiny, maduro wrapper. Nothing else of fault. I felt that the copper and blue hued band, while nothing elaborate or elegant, completed the overall look of the cigar. No overly packed or soft spots were detected in the length of the cigar as well.Moving away from my punch and using my favorite Xikar cutter and a butane lighter, I gave the cigar a couple of firm draws and took in the flavors presented to me. This is one of those Maduros that looks worse than it is, as it\u2019s a bit milder than you would think. The persistent flavors I found were a dark coffee/espresso and a touch of spice and earthiness. Nothing overpowering here but pleasant to the palette. I did find in the last third of the cigar that I felt it was burning a bit hot, as the flavors pushed towards a harsher, side.Expect a nice, even burn overall. I did have to relight the cigar a couple of times throughout the two hours and change smoke time. In the last third of the cigar, the wrapper was starting to unravel a bit from the cigar. I think this is because of the status of my secondary humidor and not necessarily from the cigar. The finish for this cigar was slightly longer, most likely because of the maduro wrapper but it is nothing out of the ordinary.This is a enjoyable, medium bodied maduro. It has a nice complement of flavors, won\u2019t bog you down in terms of strength and the price point is agreeable to most. While it didn\u2019t have the \u201cwow factor\u201d like the La Traviata, the Graycliff 1666 is certainly one I\u2019ll be looking for in the future.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

Pete has been on fire the last two years, and arguably the last 5 years. Since the first release of Noella Reservas back in 2006, people have been crawling over each other to access any of the limited production/B&M exclusives that Pete produces. The Barclay Rex has been touted as one of the greatest Tatuaje\u2019s to have ever been made, close behind possibly the original jar release of the Black Label corona gorda (soon to be review in the making!). The B-Rex, for short, is the tweaked version of the widely popular Pork Tenderloin Meat Locker Series made for Gloucester St. Cigars in Boston, which was a fatter, tweaked version of the J21. Now, I never had the opportunity to smoke the Pork Tenderloin, but I was told by many it was an incredible cigar. Only around a little less than 5,000 cigars were made of the B-Rex making it very hard to find, and even worse, extremely desirable. This will be the third B-Rex I have smoked, with one being from the release, and two being just recently. This review being written after my last B-Rex in my possession, I am sad to see them gone :(Appearance :  The B-Rex is dons a dark chocolate wrapper that appears very thick and stout. There is significant veining in the wrapper with a few that are very large. It has tight seams, is firmly packed, and has little give when squeezed. The characterizing assets of the B-Rex is it\u2019s unique pigtail and closed foot. The cigar smells of faint leather at this point in its life. The band is Pete\u2019s red, white, and blue striped band with gold trim that adorns his Exclusive Series of cigars.Construction :  The head cuts cleanly and displays a nice firm draw,\u2026 but not too firm. The closed foot lit easily and the draw remained perfectly firm. Lots of thick creamy smoke is produced by this stick.  The burn produces a flaky grey ash that has some fliers come off in my lap at times. The burn is razor sharp through half of the stick and slightly wavers from then on but corrects itself. Never had much problems with the three cigars I have smoked over the last year.Flavor :  Once the foot was torched I was met with initial black peppery spice to the back of my throat, and then I was hit with some Graham cracker and clove. The beginning peppery and graham flavors reminded me of another one of my favorite cigars, the El Centurion by Don Pepin.  A half inch in and the pepper dials back quite a bit and sort cruises into some signature brown label Miami Tat flavors. The second half of the 1st third ends with touches of clove, leather, and cocoa powder.The 2nd third is hitting a sweet spot of incredible rollercoaster like flavors. The consistent leather and woodsy flavors continue but coming in and out of the picture are floral and cinnamon notes. The creaminess is very enjoyable. At this point in the B-Rex\u2019s life, the flavors are reminiscent of the RC184 in the 2nd third (another incredible Tatuaje cigar with Cuban flavor roots). Weird enough, the flavors sing more when the cigar is cherry red while taking semi-frequent puffs. The end of the 2nd third pops with meaty, chocolate notes,\u2026 nice!The last 3rd of this cigar is where the flavors amp up and smack you like your doctor did when you came screaming into this world! A light pepper nuance sits on the tongue, and previous flavors have transitioned to dark chocolate, cinnamon, meat, and deep leather notes. A flavor bomb still for a >year old stick; this guy has some staying power and should age for many more years.Value :  At release time, $10.00 was one heck of a bargain for this cigar. The complex flavors and large format really made this stick a steal at MSRP. Unfortunately word got out about how great these were and people were willing to pay premium for them.

Normally I love Drew estate, both the dirt and acid varieties are rich and flavorful. So when the tabacco shop had neither I was sold the pricey T-52 and it was the worst smoke I ever had.

I told the shop owner that I don\u2019t like strong cigars and he told memthat this is less strong than the Dirt Naturals \u2013 he needs to have his head examined. As someone who grew up smoking Cubans it amazes me how people in the US equate strong, bitter, and flavorless cigars (like the T-52) with Cubans. What they fail to understand is that a good Cuban cigar is not strong, just very full of flavor. I would have far preferred a $7 La Gloria Cubana to this $15 monstrosity. Drew Estate should be ashamed of themselves.", "Mike, Thank you for your input; however there seems to be some miscommunication here.  No where in the review did I equate the T-52 with a Cuban made or \u201cCuban style\u201d cigar and browsing the comments above, neither did anyone else.

It\u2019s a nice cigar that had an excellent draw and perfect brun. However, my impression is that this is not a tremendously flavorful or aromatic stick.  As mentioned above, it is a very mellow cigar and it is very difficult to pin down the flavors because they are so mild.  I smoked a wonderful Illusione Phantom LE (similar price but hard to find) several hours before the T52 and the T52 does not hold a candle to it.  I honestly expected more.  The wrapper had my mouth savoring over lighting up this stick but it just didn\u2019t deliver all the way.  I am certainly not saying it\u2019s a bad cigar and I thought it was quite good.  It just fell a little short of my expectations.  Perhaps strengthen up these babies and you\u2019ve got a winner.", "Being from Canada, I appreciate good cigars when I seldom get them. This cigar started with thick smoke and amazing subtle leather and strong spice and cocoa flavor. 1.5 inches in now and its still a great smoke, but is losing some of the amazing cocoa flavor it started with. It still has a perfect draw, ash and burn. The other 4 I have will have to sit in my humidor for awhile, if I can rsist them. The one I am smoking I received today in the mail and I couldn\u2019t wait for it to rest. 2 inches now and it is staying consistent. Easy on the tongue. Less peppery than when it started, but I like it better that way. 1/2 done now and it is tasting  bit ashy, but otherwise is still a good smoke.

It\u2019s now less than 15 minutes after enjoying it and I am still feeling and tasting the beautiful flavors and relaxation of the T52.

She said it was one of their favorites from the 2009 IPCPR convention and they were going to be selling them at their shop.  The cigar; the new Liga Privada T-52 from Drew Estate.  Well when I hear Drew Estate, what comes to mind is \"flavored\" and \"infused\", not necessarily premium cigars; however, I respect the Pecunes families opinion, so I settled back into a big leather chair in their cigar lounge with it.  Please understand that I am not being critical of anyone's personal taste, \"flavored\" and \"infused\" cigars just aren't my preference is all.  Don't forget, taste is subjective!Liga Privada means \"Private Blend\" and Drew Estate claims it was originally intended not for general release but to be smoked by their President, Steven Saka.  They say that while looking for something unique, they discovered a farmer in Connecticutt who was experimenting with a new sungrown Connecticutt broadleaf stalk-cut varietal he called, \"American Habano.\"  According to Drew Estate, this new American Habano capa (wrapper) is hand-fermented, not sweated; the capote (binder) is Brazillian Mata-Fina; and the tripa (filler) is a combination of Dominican, Nicaraguan, and Honduran tobaccos, with each finished cigar aged at least a year.  They are being released in various vitollas ranging in price from $10.65 to $14.20.  The one I smoked was a Toro, 6 x 52.The T-52's wrapper was dark and oily with a color I put somewhere between colorado-maduro to maduro.  It had a nice texture with slight teeth and an almost slippery feeling.  The pre-light aroma was very mild but pleasant and a cut with a double-guillotine revealed a very good draw with an interesting flavor that left a slight sensation of pepper on the tip of the tongue.  The 52 lit easily and I noticed right away that the heat made oil extrude from the wrapper up to about 1/4 inch from the ember.  I have heard about some unreputable makers coating their cigars with adjuncts and claiming it was an oily wrapper, but I have to say, this looked like the real thing.  The flavor started off mellow with subtle notes that were hard to pin down; maybe cocoa, maybe coffee bean.  Retro-exhalation was pretty easy overall with mild to moderate spice sensations from around mid-sinus all the way to the end of the nose.  It produced a light-grey to almost white smoke with moderate amounts from the draw and lots from the foot making me wonder if it was burning too fast.  The smoke was cool and smooth though and by the end of the first 1/3, pepper notes began to emerge down the sides and on the tip of the tongue with the slightest note on the back of the throat.I was more than 2 inches into it and the medium to dark-grey ash, which was crisp and grainy, was still hanging on.  I finally knocked it off just to keep from eventually making a mess of myself and looking like an amateur.  In the middle 1/3 a mouth watering flavor developed inside the lips and slightly more pepper emerged with the overall flavor picking up around mid-mouth and on top of the tongue.  I detected leathery notes around the mid-way point which I realized may have been one of the flavors earlier that I wasn't able to pin down.  Past the half-way point I detected creamy, chocolaty notes, and that mouth watering flavor progressed.  Into the final 1/3 a fair peppery spice emerged which carried through to the end.The T-52 didn't require any touch-ups or re-lights until close to the nub and the easy retro-exhalation continued until the final 1/3.  There was some complexity of flavor, which while subtle throughout, was certainly present.  I have to say it, this was a good cigar and I recommend it.  I even tried one with a glass of ruby Porto and they went well together. Drew Estate may not make most of their living in the realm of traditional cigars, but that doesn't mean they don't know how.

However that\u2019s not all\u2026 the cigars only contain visos and ligeros (no seco leaves are used in this blend). The Black Market cigars come in boxes of 22 that look like old cargo crates and are available in the following sizes:Robusto 5 1/4 x 52; Toro 6 x 50; Churchill 7 x 50; Torpedo 6 1/8 x 54; and Gordo 6 x 60.The pre-light ritual for the AB Black Market was most disappointing.  The cap on the cigar was sloppy and uneven.  The smell of the stick revealed a stout barnyard and tiny shots of mint.  Wrapper had plenty of heavy veins and one very noticeable blemish was found upon removal of the large foot band (which did not come off with ease).The secondary band that remained on the cigar was halfway up the stick and had a military look to the print decorated with black and steel.  Near that middle band was excessive glue stains all over the wrapper leaf.  The cold draw was very tight and showed an empty mushroom taste.The AB Black Market started out with a cool fresh smoke that was leathery and mildly sweet.  After a couple of puffs however the remainer of the cap began to come off in my mouth (don\u2019t think my Xikar guillotine did a bad job as it has yet to let me down).  The burn was however dead even and resulted in a gray powdery ash.Into the second third of my Black Market by Alec Bradley the tastes took a turn for the better, becoming creamy and bready with a leathery undercoat lingering on the palate.  Upon continuing, however, the cream dissipated and a meaty burnt spice led to medium body smoking experience.Not expecting much into the final third the cigar became spongy and tart.  It remained in the medium bodied range the entire smoke and the aroma had an awkward Indian Curry characteristic to it.  The finish showed more muttled ill defined tastes that were very\u2026 boring.To sum up my overall experience with the Alec Bradley Black Market, I would label this cigar as just another bland blend on the already large market.  With such a market, cigar producers need to be releasing products that really stick out (not just a cool band or packaging idea).  This is a perfect example of that.  Aside from the unique name and band (presentation), this cigar just doesn\u2019t cut it.  Pass on this one.Pre-Light: 6 pts. Smoking: 7 pts.

I didn\u2019t let those construction issues turn me away though.  Over time I kept revisiting the Oliva V in various different vitolas and ultimately the Belicoso really won me over to the point that the Oliva Serie V Belicoso was second only to the Tatuaje Havana Cazadores as my most often smoked cigar this past year.  I guess that is a bit of a spoiler in terms of what is to come in this review but there you have it.The Serie V Belicoso is a stout looking fellow.  Its tapered head creates the illusion of it being shorter that it really is.  At first glance you might suspect it is a relatively short smoke, but the truth is you\u2019ll need more than an hour to work your way through this thick, slow burning stogie.  It burns slow, cool, and and even with a firm, dark gray ash.  I have found these to have a consistently nice draw offering up the perfect amount of resistance.  They are impeccably constructed and consistent from stick to stick and box to box.  The wrapper is a deep rich brown color and it is smooth and oily looking with only a few small veins.  The wrapper on the Series V seems a little darker to me now than it was when they were first released in 2007.The V Belicoso starts off with a blast of pepper and earth.  It is a surprisingly smooth and creamy considering how robust it is.  A Medium to full bodied smoke, it has an earthy twang complimented by leather, black coffee and oak.

The ash was firm, did not flake and held on for extended periods of time.  Deductions were made for the touch ups, re-light and the lumpy spots that perhaps contributed to the uneven burn.Flavor :  Pre-light aromas were of exotic spice, dark chocolate, leather and sweet cedar. The pre-draw offered up some sweet cedar, hints of dark tea and leather.On lighting the LFD I was overwhelmed with spice. I was not impressed. It was far too much spice to start the cigar that lingered in my mouth for a very long time making it extremely hard to actually discern any flavor.  This overwhelming spice diminished about halfway through the first third.  Once I got past that blast of heat I started to pick up hints of chocolate, dried fruit, tea and mild citrus.The flavors transitioned nicely from cocoa, sweet wood, tea, dried fruit and leather.  The spice was always there in the finish but thankfully by the start of the second third and until just past halfway, it was a lot more tolerable.The second third leading into the final third continued to offer a nice mix between the aforementioned flavors.  I actually found the Double Ligero sweeter as I smoked it.  This helped a lot with balancing the still strong exotic type of spice that was in the finish.  It had a very enjoyable salty/sweet residue on the lips and the smoke\u2019s texture started out dry but became a bit more lush and velvety as I smoked it.  It was never a honey-like thickness though.  Still, there was that ever present pepper that did diminish but came back again near the final third.I continued to get flavors of sweet wood and leather with background hints of sweet cocoa, mild citrus and tea.   Only once did I get a little bitterness best described as unsweetened coffee but certainly not anything harsh.By the time I removed the band I was really feeling the nicotine. This cigar is a power bomb.   I did eat a hearty meal beforehand because I had heard these cigars could be quite strong.  Perhaps too strong for my liking because smoking the final bit after removing the band simply became too much for me, a hardened cigar smoker.  I was sweating and definitely had a nicotine rush.  Not helping matters was the re-emergence of the overwhelming spice that had returned again in the final third, taking over the palate.I want to make something clear.  The flavors (when I actually got to taste some) were fabulous.  The cigar had great complexity and transitions.  The problem was, there wasn\u2019t enough coming through the spice.  With less spice I would have scored this cigar higher.Value :  $8.75 per stick is what I paid for this cigar in the United States.

However, this is not the only thing that makes this cigar unique, as the tobaccos chosen for the wrapper(s) have not been used by the La Gloria Cubana brand.  In an interview with Cigar Aficionado, Michael Giannini, marketing director for General Cigar, stated, \u201cWe thought about this like we were at a restaurant eating food.  The Connecticut Shade (at the foot of the cigar) is the appetizer, and this is the big entr\u00e9e (pointing to the Ecuador Sumatra wrapper).\u201d The design is intended for the smoker to experience two separate distinct flavors as the cigar is smoked.The La Gloria Cubana Artesanos de Tabaqueros is available in three different sizes:The cigar had two shades of wrapper with lots of big veins all over the dark half of the wrapper leaf.  The foot looked underfilled and a soft spot was found in the Connecticut shade part of the cigar.  The band was used to cover where the two wrapper leaves were connected and the sloppy cap looked as if it should have been a triple seam, but only two were visible.  The pre-light smell was cedar and fresh tobacco and the cold draw was loose and showed only slight signs of sweetness and tobacco.The first third of the La Gloria Cubana Artesanos de Tabaqueros 750 was full-bodied and produced a ton of golden thick smoke.  There was some harshness in the opening but eventually the cigar turned sweet with light hints of pepper.The burn was uneven the entire first third which could be related to the underfilling or soft spot I found.  The best part of this third was the very pleasant and relaxing aroma the cigar released.Into the second third the burn started to straighten itself out but was still a little wavy. The transition over the two wrappers gave way to a very bitter taste that was extremely unenjoyable. The draw was nice giving the perfect resistance to each puff and the taste after the wrapper transition was dry and empty. The ash became a solid gray that was flowering after the wrapper transition.The final third was more of the same from the taste department\u2026 lots of bitterness with some papery notes. The burn went back to being lopsided and needed lots of attention.  By the end I was well over this cigar and was more than ready for it to end.The La Gloria Cubana Artesanos de Tabaqueros needs a lot of attention!  The burn was terrible the entire time just like the cigar didn\u2019t want to stay lit.  This monster smoke stack hardly delivered any \u201cflavor\u201d and in the end just seemed like a waste of time.  For the price there are plenty of other cigars on the market that deliver much more \u201cbang for the buck.\u201d  I do however appreciate the innovative idea that LGC has tried but the elements of taste, burn, and complexity are just plain missing.  My vote is to pass on this cigar.Pre-Light: 7 pts. Smoking: 5 pts. Overall Experience: 4 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb. For more of his articles and his scoring guide, click here.

Launched in 2008, the line consisted of three blends (Connecticut, Criollo and Habano Colorado) until the recent IPCPR 2012 show which saw an addition to the family, the HC Series Habano Squared (=Habano\u00b2).According to the press-release, this blend was \"unearthed\" by Kurt Van Keppel and Scott Almsberger, co-founders of Xikar, on one of their recent travels. According to rumors, it is made in Nicaragua at A.J. Fernandez's factory and the blend is a mix of Nicaraguan, Honduran and Ecuadorian tobacco pulled together with an Ecuadorian Habano 2000 wrapper.Kaitlyn from Xikar was very kind to send me a sampler of the new cigars; here is my review.Appearance :  The appearance is pretty solid with an almost veinless wrapper leaf holding together a box-pressed 5x50 vitola that looks regularly filled.

Time to light the H\u00b2! Within a few seconds the cigar is perfectly lit and I can enjoy clouds of white, aromatic smoke. The beginning is mostly woody (oak) with a spicy background. White pepper, ginger? Medium-bodied, it goes on deploying even more flavors in the second third. For instance, I occasionally detect some dried fruits and hazelnut although it doesn't drift much from the initial combination of oak and white pepper. It's one of those cigars that you can easily nub because there's no harshness at all however close the burn line gets to your fingers. In terms of flavors, the addition of heavy earthy flavors is noticeable in the last third.

The first one I had at the Ashton event had a slight hint of fresh hay or manure. This seems to have dissipated with this small amount of aging. In my pre-light tasting was also the taste of tobacco and a touch of pepper. This was a sign of things to come. After lighting it with my Z-Plus, I was immediately hit with the trademark Pepin blast of pepper. This went away quickly after the first inch giving way to rich caramelized tastes and some woody notes. The pepper was ever present on the retro-hale but not so much it burned the sinuses. There were some nutty flavors as well. The finish was very long in the mouth.In the second third it got a bit sweeter with some cinnamon, caramel notes. The flavors still linger quite a bit.In the final third the flavors became a bit muted which was a little disappointing. The pepper came back as did some woody tastes. I hate using the term creamy but that is the only way I could describe it. Everything was just a little muted at this point. I did smoke it down to about a half inch.

I like the smell, the excellent construction, and the burn. As of right now it is probably one of my favorite cigars and I will grab another five-pack.

After lighting it with my Z-Plus, I was immediately hit with the trademark Pepin blast of pepper. This went away quickly after the first inch giving way to rich caramelized tastes and some woody notes. The pepper was ever present on the retro-hale but not so much it burned the sinuses.

Roberto Martin Perez.\u201d This cigar highlighted the Cuban experience and life of an outspoken critic of Fidel Castro\u2019s communist regime. Roberto Perez spent a total of 28 years in jail in Cuba, and he was referred by Castro as the \u201cfather of the prisoners.\u201d The initial release of the book was in Spanish, and personally I have not read it. The cigars, 364 boxes of 10 (3640 total), were specifically blended for this release using the same Habano wrapper as the original 601 Red, but the filler tobaccos are unique to this stick. These cigars can be differentiated by the secondary \u201cEdicion 2010 Limitada\u201d band below the newer 601 Red label.I bought a box of these cigars awhile back and planned on doing a review of them, but like a few other sticks, I ended up enjoying them so much that I smoked up all my stock. I acquired a few more from Brooks @ Smoking Stogie.com that I am doing the review on today. Just to note, this is not like any other Pepin made stick.

This is also a cigar you leave alone for a few minutes come back and it will still be burning really well.Flavor :  Pepin made the perfect Cuban cigar without Cuban tobacco. At this point with months of aging, this cigar has lost any spice that used to be present in the beginning of this cigar. A substantial amount of cedar flavor is tasted with the first few puffs and then a hay flavor appears. The smoke has a sweet tobacco and vanillin flavor to it. This flavor profile remains solid throughout the 1st third.In the 2nd third, flavors move harmoniously to sugar cane, vanilla, and hay. The body of the cigar is definitely medium which is perfect for me. In the end of this portion of the cigar the flavors are a little fuller/darker and remind me of the sweetness I get in hoisin sauce. This round sweetness remains combined with hay, funk, and cedar.The conclusion of this cigar transitions to milk chocolate and cedar with some asian five spice. The flavor profile just remains incredible with transitions bouncing from one to the other in a smooth fashion. Even though the body is medium, the nicotine content is significant in this one. This cigar allows you to get the full experience from your taste buds and sinuses, \u2018cause you can retrohale the entire time while smoking it.

As I know I have smoked a few of these in the past but couldn\u2019t really remember if I liked it or not, I figured this one was as likely a candidate for interrogation as anything else in the humidor. The only problem with this review was that I started it too late in the evening and ended up not being able to get photos once I started smoking.Giving the cigar my customary physical examination, I found that the veiny Nicaraguan Habano wrapper was a bit on the dry side, both in touch and to its appearance but no issues otherwise. It is unknown to me how long the cigar was in his humidor before it reached me, and I know for a fact that he let his humidification lapse before shipping the humidor to me. The cigar felt properly rolled throughout its length, detecting no soft or overpacked spots.The wrapper was the visual cue for what was discovered when I cut the cap: the cigar was a bit on the dry side, even with three months of proper humidification. Cutting the cap became an explosion of dry tobacco. This, however, was not near enough to stop this review. Lighting the cigar and taking the first draws, I was met with a peppery spice, followed about 10 minutes later with hints of wood, all while in the realm of full-bodied. While I enjoyed the full-bodied flavor of this cigar, I felt that was more or less the summation of the flavor spectrum. Honestly, for the price of the cigar, it\u2019s not a bad thing.I got even draws from the Gran Habano Corojo #5 throughout the smoking time. Thick, white smoke as well. It certainly helped in keeping the bugs away from me that night. With the full-bodied flavor of this cigar, expect a longer finish on your palate.Good but not great in my opinion. Bear in mind that they are not a bad deal for what you are paying for this cigar. I don\u2019t find this to be a complex cigar in terms of flavors, just a straight up full-bodied smoke. I would be interested in getting ahold of a couple of fresh sticks and see how they compare to my aged one and see if they differ.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

The company has touted this cigar in its use of three different tobaccos from different regions in Nicaragua, making for a balanced and enjoyable smoking experience.Like the La Escepcion from my last review, I found the Perdomo Habano by accident, the box stuck in a corner of my B&M\u2019s walk-in humidor. As I have not had as much experience in smoking the wares of Perdomo as I do of other popular cigar brands, I thought this would be a great time to get more acquainted with this line from Perdomo.While I didn\u2019t find any issues or problems with the veiny, Cuban-seed corojo wrapper pre-burn, I did find that once I removed the band (designed from Cuban artwork from the 1900\u2019s) I had a crack in the wrapper about an inch in length. I am unsure that if this was present pre-burn or if it happened during the smoking time. Thankfully, the crack didn\u2019t inhibit the smoking in any way. The cigar did have a strong cedar aroma pre-burn. This is most likely from the Spanish Cedar box that the cigars shipped in.The initial hint of flavor that came right in the first draw of the Perdomo Habano Corojo Torpedo was cocoa, but dissipated within five minutes of smoking and was replaced with a hint of sweetness. The draw on this cigar was balanced: open, effortless with a minimum amount of resistance. During the halfway point of the cigar, I detected leathery hints, while the sweet flavors from the beginning took a backseat. In the last third is where I got a strong flavor of burnt coffee, and it stayed prominent throughout the end of the smoke time.While I would categorize this cigar medium bodied, the last third of this cigar is much stronger than first two thirds because of that burnt coffee flavor. While I am a big proponent of full bodied cigars, this flavor doesn\u2019t go away and borders on bitter, especially when you have the same kind of flavor for at least 30 minutes.No issues were found with the burn, although I did have to relight the cigar a couple time throughout the smoking time. Expect a white, firm ash from this cigar. I never felt I would end up with a lap or shirt full of ash, which is always a bonus. Because of the flavors of the last third of the cigar, the finish on the cigar is a bit longer than what I would consider normal (couple of hours).Another cigar that was good but didn\u2019t blow me away. The burnt coffee flavors from the last third of the cigar almost killed it for me. I would be curious to know if anyone has taken the time to let these sit for a few months to see if the final flavors toned down and got more in line with the rest of the cigar. I may end up doing just that to give this cigar proper closure.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents. Click here for their latest articles and more information.

The critics were gasped when the Casa Magna topped the list at CA back in 2008. I really thought the Casa Magna Colorado from 2008 was a truly polished cigar, but nowhere near the top of the tobacco heap. Then Quesada and Casa Magna came out with the Domus Magnus this last year proving the hype behind Casa Magna was not a fluke, and with their best efforts, put out the best Casa Magna ever (in my honest opinion).Appearance :  The Optimus has a Colorado brown wrapper that has minimal veins and firm box press. The label is the new eye catching yellow and red band with \u201cDomus Magnus Limitada\u201d distinguishing it from the other Casa Magna cigars. No imperfections anywhere on the cigar. It is capped off with a fairly long nippled end and adorned with a foot band as well. Cigar smells of bitter sweet chocolate and light leather.Construction :  The cigar was surprisingly hard to squeeze and had hardly any give to the wrapper which is unusual for box presses. Some light oiliness covers the wrapper. Getting the foot to burn took a little extra heat but once lit the cigar burned quite straight with 1 or 2 touch ups and dropped off 1 \u00bd inch chunks of salt and pepper ash. The draw on the cigar was perfectly firm but not a whole lot of smoke can be pulled with each puff (it was enough but I would like more smoke).Flavor :  After torching the foot, I was hit with some soapiness and some astringency. After four or five puffs this blew off and some slightly sweet straight tobacco flavors came out back ended by a touch of cognac/rum.1st Third: The retrohale is very fragrant and slightly floral with leather notes. The cigar hits around the medium bodied range from the start and the smoke feels quite light and clean on the palate. Not a whole lot of pepper anywhere to be found. Relatively a sleeper through most of the 1st third, it livens up and punches the palate and sinuses, near the end of the first third, with some leather and spiced meatiness,\u2026 now we are rolling!While smoking this cigar, one may notice a high amount of acidity that lends itself to tasting a little like coconut cr\u00e8me or lemon meringue (?), which is the closest thing I can compare it too. The acidity is a little unsettling and kind of hides some underlying flavors. I get the feeling that these sticks may be a little young and would shine with a year or two of sleep under their belt.2nd Third: Coffee bean and bitter chocolate flavors continue and are still backed with noticeable amounts of acidity and saltiness. This is where the cigar is reminiscent of its cheaper cousin, the Casa Magna Colorado. But that is as far as the comparisons get to its award winning kin, because the end of 2nd third hits me with some significant amounts of pepperiness in combo with dark chocolate and coffee bean.3rd Third: Ooooo yea! I like what I get now. The draw opens up and I can get more smoke now, plus the flavors are simple and amped up. Maltiness is the key flavor now with the other flavors from the last part of the second third,\u2026 A nice finish for a roller coaster of a cigar.Value :  For the money this is spot on. Sub $9 for a premium smoke from a cigar maker with credentials is not much to ask for these days. Even better is that these can be had in boxes of ten which cuts down on one\u2019s commitment of large down payment for a taste.Overall Rating :  I\u2019m a little perplexed. I have a hard time giving this stick a high rating because I just feel that this cigar is a little awkward and just plain off. The flavors are all over the place which is good, but the bad thing is that they aren\u2019t very cohesive. The acidity is kinda annoying and makes me feel that these will need some age. But considering that previous statement, this cigar has plenty of flavors to last awhile and should age beautifully. With more time I see the flavors marrying more and becoming more mature and complex instead of a pestering little child missing his dose of Ritalin.This post was written by Aaron.

Upmann Legacy cigars...The H. Upmann Legacy 2008 is the newest release (along with the Upmann Havoc) from Altadis.  This premium cigar comes in 3 vitolas: A Corona (5 \u00bd\u201d x 44) at $5.85, a Robusto (5\u201d x 54) at $6.50 and a Toro (6\u201d x 52) at $6.85.  We are reviewing the Toro.First off, this is one beautiful cigar.  From it silky, coffee colored wrapper to its complimentary double banding, this stick screams for you to give it a try.  And heed its call we did.  We knew that we were heading towards a good experience, being that this cigar is a continuation of the heritage of the growing family of H. Upmann.The pre-light aroma was earthy, with perhaps a touch of grassiness.  A clean scent reminiscent of some of the top guns in the industry.  As the foot was toasted the aroma amplified but did not overpower.  I used a plug while my fellow Tollaficionado team members used a guillotine, and either way the cap cut perfectly.  No cracking or peeling under the pressure.  A touch from the torch and a puff or two and immediately a firm salt and pepper ash began to grow.The oils on the wrapper allowed for a pleasant taste on the lips, and a nice sensation on the fingertips.  As the cigar continued its burn to about the halfway point, the prominent notes were of wood and hay.  Flavor wise, this cigar sat right on the medium bodied line, never straying from this point.Right through from foot to cap, the H. Upmann Legacy 2008 displayed immaculate construction.  A perfectly even burn, firm ash, perfect draw and a wrapper that held up to the heating stick without splitting or flaking at all made this a top shelf constructed cigar.  Beyond the aesthetics,  this is the perfect cigar for both Upmann fans and those who prefer their smoke to have flavor without too much bite.  Its medium bodied profile is well suited for aficionados and novices alike.With the quality and price point of this well know brand, expect to see them move  from the tobacconists humidors to the customers very quickly.Here\u2019s Wishing You A Long Ash!The Tollaficionados Name (required) Mail (will not be published) (required) Website    Notify me of followup comments via e-mail", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/images/cigar/upmann-legacy.png"}, "illusione 2": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Torpedo Size : 5 1/4 x 52 Wrapper : Nicaraguan Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : ~$8-9 eachMore info about purchasing Illusione cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "illusione", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/illusione/illusione-2", "full review": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Torpedo Size : 5 1/4 x 52 Wrapper : Nicaraguan Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : ~$8-9 eachMore info about purchasing Illusione cigars...The Illusione ~2~ looks feisty.  Short and stubby but a deep brown that exudes power and as I turn it to peer down the foot, I see a dense weave of ligero throughout the bunch.As I light it, I find myself a bit surprised.  At first it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to be as spicy as I thought and certainly not as spicy as the ~mk~ (which is a limited release with an extra oomph thrown in).Maybe this is like the Bolivar Belicoso Fino from Cuba?  The BBF is a thick torpedo that sub-delivers on purpose and gives you a nice mellow mild smoke.As I smoke further I realize this is not going to be a BBF, but it will not be as strong as the little firecracker known as the ~mk~.  This cigar actually has some sweetness, but there is also a mesquite meatiness to the flavor (maybe I should back away from the grill).  But really, this is a sweet, meaty smoke, with just a touch of pepper and cedar.The smoke is voluminous and the ash is very flaky which is typical of a lot of Nicaraguan tobacco.  The burn is mostly even though it does partially canoe in a few places.The really cool thing is that this cigar is so different from the ~mk~, which hopefully means this is the case throughout the whole line.As I smoke thru the halfway point, the cigar gets even sweeter and woodier.  I am enjoying this cigar referred to \u201cand crowned of thorns\u201d from the Illusione website.The finish is nice and long and I pick up the standard licorice/anise notes at the end (this is pretty common as the cigar heats up, tar is produced which often gives off a licorice taste).I like this quite a bit more than the ~mk~, as I prefer refined to power.

I typically do not spend over $15.00 on a cigar unless I know it to be eccentric, however I really wanted to try this Opus X blend, so I splurged.  Let's find out if it was worth it.In 2004 Hollywood actor/director Andy Garcia wanted to produce a film telling the story of a Cuban tobacco family\u2019s struggles during the Castro revolution.  In one of the movie\u2019s scenes Garcia wanted to duplicate a Cuban tobacco farm.  After being introduced to Carlito Fuente, owner of Tabacalera A. Fuente y Cia, Garcia proposed the idea of shooting a scene with the tobacco plants in the background.  Carlito was in favor of the idea however harvest was right around the corner making it impossible to film.  Being the gentleman he is, Carlito offered to plant a field of tobacco after harvest and by June Garcia would have a field of three-foot plants to shoot in his scene.  When asked what he would do with the tobacco Fuente replied \u201cIf it is good, I will use it.\u201d  That\u2019s when Garcia suggested the idea of making a special blend bearing the logo from the movie, \u201cThe Lost City\u201d which would later become the name on the cigars.  The rest from there is history.  The tobacco, seen in the movie, is the same used in The Lost City blend.The Lost City cigars are available in five different sizes at varying prices.  Each box of 10 comes with a copy of the movie The Lost City, certificate of authenticity, and sports an individual serial number. The boxes' MSRP is as follows:The pre-light ritual for The Lost City didn't really go well.  There were two cracks in the wrapper at the foot of the cigar.  Large veins running head to foot and the overall appearance was very rough looking.The cap had been applied very sloppily and started to unravel after being cut. The band was very elaborate with a dark fire glow however excessive glue had been used to apply it, leaving marks near both the upper and lower bands.  Pre-light smell contained signs of cream and tea, which I very much enjoy and the cold, tight draw showed signs of sweet tobacco.The Opus X Lost City proved to be a heavy, full-bodied smoke from the start.  The first third showed tastes of leather and spice and was a touch musty, but not in a bad way.  The cigar had a nice firm white ash and the burn was a little wavy but did not need to be touched up.  The most exciting part however came at the end of the first third when my palate was teased with sweet honey and tea notes.  I really love these characteristics in a cigar!These wonderful flavors didn\u2019t last long though. In fact, they had dissipated by the time I began the second third.  The second third started nice and cool leaving my palate refreshed.  The draw on The Lost City was perfect, and glorious coffee notes lasted through the end of the second third.Another problem did occur when removing the first band.  It had been covering another crack (third one) in the cigar's wrapper leaf.  So far the first two had not really had a huge affect on the cigars burn and draw performance so hopefully the third rip will surpass too.The final third on my Fuente Fuente Opus X Lost City continued with roasted coffee notes however nearing the end became mottled with a bitter floral taste.Overall this was a very delightful cigar showing lots of complexity.  It is most certainly a full-bodied smoke so I do not recommend it to those beginning palates however, I think this is the perfect example of a cigar smoking and tasting better than it looks.  Remember construction is not the only aspect of a good cigar.  I will probably not restock these in my humidor solely due to the hefty price tag they carry but if you have a few extra Benjamin\u2019s you might consider picking a few up.Pre-Light: 7 pts.

Alberto Medina came back to the cigar market after some legal issues with the PIO Overture 1996.  The Resurrection line comes in three vitolas:  a Churchill, a Torpedo, and the featured Robusto.

The wrapper did not exhibit any oily sheen.The cigar felt firm to the touch. The cigar had a very nice light feel in the hands.  Maybe this ergonomic effect is due to the fact that the cigar is box-pressed.The band was large, and it had the word \u201cPIO\u201d in very large block letters written in the band.  It also had the words \u201cResurrection\u201d and Miami written in smaller letters.  The band is primarily bronze in color with some black where Resurrection and Miami are written.Construction :  The cigar is single capped, and it seems that the cigar is very well held together by just this cap.The ash was dark grey, and it looked well put together.  At the beginning of the smoke, the burn was very even; however, a canoeing effect developed.  Also, the wrapper seemed to blister a bit around the burn line.  The ash also started to flake a bit around that blister line.    I fixed the canoe with the lighter, and the cigar continued to burn evenly.  However, towards the second half of the cigar, the canoe returned.  In my opinion, this canoe is due to some issue with the rolling of the cigar.   I let the cigar go out completely and cut the offending part of the cigar; then I re-lit it; no such luck as the canoe came back.  I decided to pitch the cigar at this point.About an inch of ash was obtained before tapping it off in the ashtray.The smoke from the cigar was slightly abundant, and it rose and dissipated fairly quickly.Removing the band was no problem, and none of it stuck to the cigar.Flavor :  The wrapper had a herbally/floral scent to it, while the foot featured more of a hay smell.  The head had a slight peppery taste which was not overwhelming at all.I used a Cigar Spike in this cigar as I did not want to disturb the cap; I figured a V-cutter or a guillotine cutter may be too much for this cigar.  A punch cutter would work just as well.During the pre-light draw, it felt like notes of molasses were the primary taste.  The draw was pretty good.The taste and retrohale felt like roasted nuts; speaking of the retrohale, this cigar felt very comfortable in the nasal passages.  It did not burn, and it left a pleasant sensation in the nose.  Hints of roasted coffee also became apparent during the first third of the cigar.After cutting the canoe portion, the cigar had more nutty notes to it.Value :  At around $8.00 per stick, this cigar has a complex flavor profile; however, the construction issues experienced diminish the value of the cigar.

The wrapper, although not very oily and almost dry looking did have that nice Rosado Colorado shade. The pre-light aroma was definitely reminiscent of some nice strong Nicaraguan Tobacco which is just my style. And upon lighting it I found that it was in fact strong. Too strong! From beginning to end this cigar was extremely bitter(Perhaps the tobacco was a bit young). I found it hard to withstand and could not distinguish any particular flavors in this cigar other than a light sort of barnyard flavor. By the time I reached the final third I had decided that I\u2019d endured enough torture and put it to rest.

The vitola he sent was the 5-1/2 x 52 robusto, which if it matters to you was voted the #1 cigar of 2008 by Cigar Aficionado.  The colorado robusto is the result of a joint effort by Manuel Quesada, who has been making cigars since 1974 (and whose family has been in the business since the 19th century I understand), and Nestor Plasencia, the largest grower of Nicaraguan tobacco and owner of the Segovia Cigar Factory in Esteli, Nicragua.  The colorado, so named for the color of its capa, is a Nicaraguan puro made from Nicaraguan grown - Cuban seed tobacco harvested from the Esteli and Jalapa growing regions, which is then rolled at Segovia and distributed in boxes of 27.  One of the most remarkable things about this cigar is not the great reviews or high marks it has received from others, but that it did so while costing around $6.00 each!  As someone who is always on the look-out for a great every day cigar, I was looking forward to smoking this one to say the least, so I settled back on the aft-deck and made the most of a sunny, mild, February afternoon.The Casa Magna's pre-light inspection revealed a capa which I place at colorado rosado in color, deserving of its name.  It was slightly toothy, but flawless, which gave it a bit of a rugged look that I liked as well.  The squeeze was great with no soft or hard spots and was very firm all over, indicating a well packed cigar.  The foot was interesting with a visible swirl of light and dark tobaccos clearly visible in the bunch.  The pre-light aroma was dominated by sweet tobacco with maybe slightly earthy notes present as well.  Because of how well packed it was, I made a straight cut with a double-guillotine because using a punch-cutter on a cigar with a heavy bunch can make it difficult to draw and sometimes cause tarriness at the head.  After cutting, the cap held together perfectly without any fraying or annoying tobacco fragments which like to get into your mouth.  I then tested the pre-light draw which was firm and even and had what I thought was a \"hay-like\" taste.The Casa Magna lit evenly and easily with a soft-flame lighter and produced plenty of blue smoke from the draw.  As the first 1/3 progressed it produced a fairly dark grey ash which was crisp and strong.  I accidentally knocked a corner off early on and it still held on for almost 1-1/2 inches before finally dropping off.  I didn't detect any particular flavor notes in the first 1/3 other than that of full-bodied tobacco which was very consistent.  Around half-way a slight spicy tingle developed all around the tip of the tongue, which as I continued to smoke into the second half, moved to the sides.  Throughout the middle-third I thought I detected occasional ground coffee notes but couldn't be sure as they were very subtle and short-lived.  In the final 1/3 it seemed to have a slight astringent quality and perhaps some slight woody notes from time to time as well.  Throughout the entirety of the smoke, the burn remained even and consistent and needed no touch-ups or relights with the overall flavor remaining very consistent, although it didn't lend itself to retro-exhalation.  If you read my reviews or study cigars you know that isn't a negative comment at all, it's just something I like to do to get the most out of any smoke.How do I define an \"every day cigar?\"  Well, there are some cigars that are so complex and flavorful that when you smoke them you want to relax and enjoy every moment of the experience.  There are some you may reserve for only special occasions.  Then there are those that you want to be able to smoke whenever you feel like it.  Perhaps while working or golfing or while driving or maybe just when you can steal a peaceful moment.  For me at least, these cigars still have to be handmade, premium quality cigars but are such that they don't require my full time and attention and have a price that doesn't make me pause.  In a nutshell, it is a premium cigar that I can afford to smoke as I please.  For this review I smoked two on two different days and had the same results.  The Casa Magna was a pleasant smoke all the way through, had no problems, and was consistent from stem to stern.  I smoked them down to the nubs and they never built up any tar, began to fray, or developed any unpleasant taste.  The Casa Magna - Colorado is definitely going on my list of every day cigars.Good review, I\u2019m smoking it now for the first time and I\u2019m almost at the second third.

I am not a habitual cigar smoker as of late, but I am coming back to the light. Years ago I smoked almost exclusively Padron. I found that label to be the most consistent in all categories and always a great value. For the new year this year I picked up a 1926 Series #2 and was very pleased. Two days later I went back to my usual 2000 and only by juxtaposition was relatively disappointed for the 1st time in a Pardon cigar. I say all of this in an attempt to qualify my response to the LFD Double Ligero Chisel. The cigar I just finished was one of the most enjoyable cigars I have ever experienced. Again, I am not a seasoned veteran of cigardom and I don\u2019t have the budget to drop on high-priced labels. I merely put this out there for those of you, like me, that often find themselves confined, often with good reason, to a particular label. When you have found a consistently enjoyable cigar in your price range, why take a chance? If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. I was moved enough by this smoke to put this out there. Take the dive and try this cigar. I do not think you will be disappointed. Ask your local provider how they cut into the chisel before you hack into it with your pocket cutter. Mine suggested a shallow punch-cut, just inside of the wrapper on one of the flat sides. The draw is a bit different but very effective. However, approximately half way through the thoroughly moistened end cap sloughed off entirely which changed the draw for the better, leading me to think that this is the kind of cigar that you keep in your mouth for a bit before lighting up. At the risk of cigar mis-speak, it has the makings for a great golf or fishing cigar. You start your day with what you are there to do; then light it up to take it to where you hoped it would be.

Without hesitation, I snatched a few up and took them to the counter, ready and willing to spend the time interrogating this Dominican import.Giving the cigar a thorough examination, I found once again flawless construction. The veiny Ecuadorian wrapper almost had a flowery scent to it, which would match the decorative band well. I detected no soft or overpacked spots throughout the length of the cigar.Before smoking this cigar, I had heard of several varying ways of cutting this cigar. However, the best way that I found in cutting this cigar was to not cut or punch it at all. What you should do with the chisel end is to take your thumb and index finger and lightly pinch both sides of the chisel, allowing it to crack ever so slightly. Trust me - it works.I was immediately greeted with a great draw from the pinched chisel, welcoming me with slight notes of spice and cinammon. One strange finding I had with this cigar was that the smoke from the draw felt slightly cool in my mouth. That really wasn\u2019t something I was expecting at all. Not necessarily good or bad, just strange. The burn on this cigar was more or less even the whole way through, with a slight relight near the end. I did find that the spice notes at the beginning of the smoke subsided after about 25 to 30 minutes in. I would place the strength of the cigar somewhere between medium and full-bodied; enough strength to attract the heavy-hitters but still light enough to not frighten away those who walk the lighter side. The ash on this cigar was one of the sturdiest I have come across in a long time.Recommendations: If you came upon this cigar and were possibly taken aback because of the Chisel, have no fear. Use the pinch technique described above and you\u2019ll have no problems. A great draw with a nice balance of flavors, coupled with a more than fair price makes for an enjoyable cigar. It is almost a guarantee that I\u2019ll be purchasing these in the future for one simple fact: my wife loved them. Then it becomes a matter of buying enough of these to satisfy us both.

I had no idea that this was by Ashton and thought that I had actually received a Cuban because the band was so colorful and the artwork had that Cuban-esque feel to it, then I realized I couldn\u2019t have been so lucky :)The La Aroma de Cuba at first glance has a nice shiny Honduran wrapper thats just begging to be smoked and again\u2026 very colorful artwork. (I really dig the band if you can't tell). The filler is a mixture of Honduran and Cuban seed Nicaraguan that isn\u2019t overpowering and delivers a very nice medium body flavor.On first draw you get a very medium earthy-nutty flavor and excellent burn. I was expecting some burn issues with this because I usually do with Ashtons but not this one. I had to relight it only once but it was pretty much smooth sailing from the get go.I paired this with a Mike's Hard Lemonade and I have to tell you that the alcohol and lemony flavor mixed well with this stogie. Usually when I have a medium-bodied cigar I like to drink tea so it's not too overpowering but the flavor on this La Aroma de Cuba shined right through in an impressive way - the earthy nuttiness work well together.After smoking this cigar I noticed that I didn\u2019t have much of an after taste in my mouth like I usually do and I found myself wanting another one. Sadly I only had one to smoke.This is the first smoke I have ever had where I didn\u2019t want to take the band off. I would absolutely recommend you give one of these bad boys a try if you can get your hands on one, and at $5-7 a stick they are way worth it.

This time, it is a Nicaraguan puro with a Habano Oscuro wrapper. Tronco is a 5 x 52 robusto, 4 other sizes are available in the series - Trabuco (grand corona 6 1/8 x 58), La Fuerza (robusto 5 1/2 x 54), La Punta (perfecto 5 1/2 x 52) and Corona (5 x 42).Appearance :  The Habano Oscuro wrapper is quite veiny, I find it the least attractive from the series.

The rest of the cigar was more of the same, also introducing a blackberry brandy kind of finish, with the same lingering spice.Burn/Ash :  The burn gets a little jagged if you rush it. Give it 30 seconds to cool off and the burn goes straight. It stayed wavy through the first half but evened out after that, staying even all the way up to the last finger-burning puffs. The ash looked pretty good until the first ash fell unexpectedly at about an inch and a half. The second ash did the same but after that, surprisingly, the final ash held strong till the end.Draw :  Perfect from the get-go.

It's not that I'm snob or anything, but I find, more often than not, I like the Cuban taste over Dominicans, Nicaraguans, and so on. But that doesn't mean that I haven't found some wonderful non-Cuban cigars that I equally like, one being the Oliva Connecticut Reserve that I'll be reviewing today.Oliva is generally better known for their full-bodied cigars such as the Serie G, Serie O, and Serie V. The Connecticut Reserve is a special line of Oliva that is meant to appeal to mild-bodied cigar smokers who aren't looking for an over-powering cigar. The Connecticut Reserve comes in five sizes: Churchill, Lonsdale, Robusto, Torpedo, and Toro. This review will cover the Toro vitola.Also an interesting tidbit is that you will not find anything about the Connecticut Reserve on Oliva's website except on their ratings page, not sure why that is.For the price, these cigars are absolutely gorgeous! Solidly constructed and firm when squeezed, the Oliva's Connecticut wrapper has a nice caramel color with no visible discoloration or blemishes.Inspecting the foot, it looks well rolled with a good amount of tobacco. The Oliva Connecticut Reserve has, what looks like, a double-cap on the head. There are very small veins  throughout the wrapper and for the value, you'll be hard-pressed to find a better looking cigar. I think this is probably one of the best looking cigars I've had.This cigar in the Toro format certainly feels long in my hands, given my general preference for Robusto sized cigars. The burn is decent, requiring the occasional minor touch-ups to keep the burn even, and stayed lit when I had to put it down for restroom breaks. The salt-and-pepper ash stays planted to the cigar anywhere from 1-to-2 inches before breaking off.One thing I've found is that the wrapper leaf is extremely thin and can easily tear or rip if you're not gentle with it, so take care when removing the cigar band.The best part of this cigar are the flavors and taste. Prelight taste is muted with just a bit of sweetness one would expect from the Connecticut wrapper and once lit, the predominant flavors of toasted almonds and creamy butter explode on your palate for a wonderful experience. The first time I had the Connecticut Reserve, I was blown away at how flavorful it is. Originally penned as a light-bodied cigar, I've found the Oliva Connecticut Reserve is more of a light-to-medium-bodied cigar, that is hardly overpowering. My buddy, who I gave two to try, has said: \"This is the cigar I would give to someone who is new to smoking cigars.\"The flavors don't really change much as the cigar progresses, but the taste does get smoother with a hint of bitterness starts developing at about the 2/3rd mark which I think helps balance the sweetness of the Connecticut wrapper.The Oliva Connecticut Reserve is definitely worth a box purchase. You can find these guys for like $5 or less online. I got lucky and scored a 10-pack from JoeCigar.com for $2.99 a cigar! Well worth it.I can't really find anything bad to say about this cigar. For the price, the taste, and the looks, this cigar is a winner in my book.  This is a great morning or lunch cigar, something light that won't make you sick and works just as well as an after dinner cigar. A number of times if I'm enjoying a cigar with my buddy and I finish before him, I'll light up a Oliva Connecticut Reserve and it works out perfectly.If you haven't tried an Oliva, definitely try one! If you're looking for a cigar that has a lots of flavor but not over-powering, try the Connecticut Reserve and even if you're accustomed to stronger bodied cigars, try one of these anyways as you might find it compliments your taste.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/oliva-connecticut-reserve.jpg?iv=16"}, "padilla studio tobac figurado": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Figurado Size : 6 x 60 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Habano Filler : Nicaraguan Binder : Nicaraguan Hand-Made Price : $14.00 (my local B&M is more around $12.00)", "overall rating": " (4.75) Nothing about this release was overlooked.

The Padilla-Studio Tobac cigars had been sitting in my humidor staring at me for over 3 months now and for some reason or another they kept being pushed back in my rotation of review smokes time and time again. I eventually decided it was about damn time I got to them, so here goes.The gist of what this cigar is about is that it is a reach out by Studio Tobac to broaden its horizons and touch the mainstream by collaborating with some big names in the industry. So for this first collab, they reached out for the genius that is Ernie Padilla to produce a limited stick that would pair both Studio Tobac and Padilla's expertise in bringing a unique cigar to the U.S. market. The tobacco is all Oliva's but they consulted Padilla to tweak the blends. Word on the street is that this will not be the last of Studio Tobac's collaborations which is exciting news. I am personally excited to try this cigar out because I have been a huge fan of Padilla's body of work ever since the release of the original Miami 8&11 years ago. The 8&11 was a game changer for me, and has a lot to do why I am sitting here writing this review. Now on to the review,...Appearance :  Maybe it's just me, but a lot of the cigars I have been smoking lately are just amazingly beautiful. This Padilla is one of the most unique and unblemished cigars I have seen this year (even though it's a 2011 release).

Simply put, the construction is spot on and is probably one of the best burning figurados in the game.Flavor :  (4.75) The initial attack is amazingly smooth with loads of sweet floral notes. I would say it is very Cain-like in its flavor profile (should be, it\u2019s Oliva's tobacco in the cigar). There is some light woody, cedar thing going on underneath the floral qualities, very unique and delicious. While finishing off the 1st third the body is definitely medium+, but the flavor is full and doesn't seem to let up. I am almost around halfway through this mammoth cigar now, and the flavor profile has not changed much but the body is more full bodied. Ever since the first third I noticed a persistent mild spice that I pinned as white pepper. The white pepper is very aromatic from the smoke released from the foot and through the retrohale. The last half evolves seamlessly into an amalgam of sweet nuttiness, cedar, floral, and oak flavors. The increase in complexity is a nice change from the straight forward flavors for most of the first half. All in all, a great finish.Value :  It's $14, I don't have to tell anyone this is not your everyday smoke, And if it is, well, you are doing a lot better off than I am.

Leather and hazelnuts are what I detect most now, and the finish is citrusy acidic but the smoke is very creamy and thick. A little cinnamon also sneaks into the aftertaste of the smoke. It\u2019s not knocking my socks off with flavor at this point but the profile is relaxing and quite good. The body is hitting squarely in the full category.2nd Third: The second third loses almost all of the pepperiness. The creaminess seems to be the focal point, and nutty flavors dominate. A little bit of floral kick weaves in and out of the profile. All in all,\u2026 just creamy. The amount of smoke is perplexing on the draw. Some draws you only get a little smoke and then sometimes you get so much your tongue feels like its wearing velvet. There is a lingering sweetness leftover from the thick smoke on your palate though.3rd Third: Cream, cream, and more cream. The LSV displays a unique musky quality that is different from any other cigar I have smoked in a long while. There still seems to be a tiny bit of nuttiness but it's hard to discern. I have to admit the finish is quite nice and pretty intriguing.Value :  I suppose anything south of $8 is satisfactory in my book with this cigar. It has premium tobacco obviously and shows some tender loving care in production. The flavors are unique enough to find a place in many people\u2019s smoking rotations.Overall Rating :  Burn problems aside, this cigar displays a fairly unique amount of flavors for Nicaraguan tobacco. The curing process and location of the farmed tobacco seems to give it this flavor profile \u2018cause there isn\u2019t anything like this cigar. The creaminess of the smoke is quite awesome and the musky character is a little cubanesque. The sweetness in the aftertaste left on my palate after expelling the smoke in my mouth is also a plus in my book. The overall body hits near the full meter. Something, for me though, is missing in this blend, and doesn\u2019t really strike a cord that would have me pulling the trigger to buy many of these cigars (maybe it\u2019s just plainly not my profile). I think the strongest point of this cigar is the fact, I believe, that this cigar will appeal to a wide range of smokers. So give it a try. Elogio might be your new favorite smoke.

The band shows off artwork by Edin Gutierrez. I received \u201cEl Puro\u201d (7.5 x 52), which was released July 15, 2008 for IPCPR.  Each release offers different artwork on the label. Very interesting concept.I am impenetrable by swine flu, and love. The weather has been pure crap lately, and suspects have been unwilling to cooperate until Mi Barrio arrived. This was certainly a formidable foe. The cigar was about the same size as a miniature baseball bat (7.5 x 52). Without hesitation I applied blade and flame to this suspect and information flowed like the elderly to their doctors to get flu shots. Swinergy!Rough exterior, oily and dark brown. Large veins. Rustic. Solid, no squishy spots. Unique artwork.Lots of smooth, creamy earthy notes and leather. Complex and not harsh. Medium-bodied with a bit of nicotine kick progressing throughout. This cigar seemed to dry out my palate, always needed to take a drink of water after every other drag.Nice Tight Ash! About 1.5'' before it would fall off each time. No burn problems for the size.Very pleasant cigar! I could definitely notice the uniqueness of the blend from the Pepin Garcia lineage. I would like to try the other vitolas!

Bearing the name of the famed Cuban marca, the non-Cuban San Cristobal is made for Ashton by my favorite cigar maker Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia who also makes my favorite brand of cigars, the Tatuajes. By now everyone who smokes cigars is aware that Pepin is the hottest name in cigars right now. His portfolio has grown exponentially yet it seems everything he puts out is made of gold. As highly anticipated as the release of the ESG, the San Cristobal was 2 years in the making.Released last year shortly after the RTDA (now called IPCPRA), it sports Pepin\u2019s wrapper of choice. It is a leathery, dark brown Nicaraguan Corojo. The Supremo is a Toro and the 50 ring gauge is the perfect size for my new favorite cut, the butterfly cut. The butterfly cut was created by a friend of mine. It is a double V-cut. After making the initial V-cut you rotate the cigar and make a second V-cut perpendicular to the first. I really like this style of cut on larger ring gauges. This cut draws very nicely and it looks cool. Everything about this cigar says \u201ctop-shelf\u201d. The wrapper is flawless and there is no sign of any rib veins in the head or foot. The bunching looks perfect and you can tell by the firmness and heft that it is packed full of tobacco. The band is beautiful with the vibrant colors of the Macaw and elegant gold trim on a background of an ancient map.This amazing cigar is very different from any other Pepin cigar I have tried to date. It starts off so smooth and silky. Right off the bat it is very full flavored, woodsy with leather and spice, and nutty undertones. Notably absent is the trademark \u201cPepin Pepper\u201d but it isn\u2019t missed at all. This cigar is amazingly complex with a smooth finish. I read on CI\u2019s site some tasting notes that referenced cherry flavors. I have never tasted anything like cherry in a cigar, so I was really surprised when at about the midway point I detected flashes of cherry. It was amazing and truly unique. I found myself disappointed (in a good way) when those flavors faded as I got a little further into the smoke. I really wished that the cherry flavors hung around longer than they did. Towards the end, the leather and spice began to build to dominate the flavors with a woody finish.This was an amazing cigar that engaged me from start to finish. The construction is impeccable and the burn razor sharp. The ash was a little loose and flaky which was surprising but didn\u2019t detract from the experience. The San Cristobal has earned a spot on my list of favorites. This cigar is an absolute must try for any serious cigar smoker.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

The good news is with more daylight and warmer temperatures the cigars smoking will increase along with barbecues and good outdoor fellowship.This week I wanted to review a semi new cigar.  Being released in May of 2011 the Zino \u201cZ\u201d Class line is defined as a stronger / powerful / more full-bodied line without a hefty price tag.  The \u201cZ\u201d Class cigars come packaged in sleek streamlined metal tin boxes of 20.  These cigars are currently available in the following sizes:This line will typically run you from $8 \u2013 $12 which is much less expensive than your regular Zino/Davidoff makeshift brands.  Let\u2019s see how the 550R fared.On to the review\u2026The pre-light ritual for the Zino 550R showed a splotchy brown wrapper, nice round cap, and a foot that was easily under filled.  Lots of thick veins ran up and down the wrapper and the seam lines were not applied smoothly.  Band had a nice sophisticated industrial steel look and the smell showed a distinct sweet tobacco and tealeaves.  Upon clipping for the cold draw I was surprised at what an extremely loose draw the cigar carried.  The cold palate tastes supported a spicy hay texture.Upon lighting I am very upset at the draw being much too loose and am blasted with loads of smoke.  The velvety smoke overloads my palate with heavy pepper and a hot unbalanced experience.  The burn was very fast on the first third which when combined with the loose draw leads me to believe the cigar was under filled.  The aroma however was pleasant showing a creamy subtleness, which was by far the best attribute of the first third.  Before moving into the second third the cigar\u2019s burn had to be touched up.The second third of my Zino \u201cZ\u201d Class 550R was more of the same.  The burn was terrible throughout, the draw an absolute wind tunnel leading to an overpowering smoke that muted out any tastes the cigar was trying to show.  Was however able to pick up some flinty lead tastes and certainly was not entertained with the fact I had one more third of this to go.The final third the smoke was still an overload however I was able to enjoy some dark fruit flavors on the finish.  The cigar did end better than it started however was not enjoyable\u2026 at all.Well let\u2019s make this short and sweet.  The Zino 550R had a terrible draw (too loose), unbalanced flavors (due to draw), quick uneven burn that had to be touched up multiple times, a decent opening aroma, and a bland unstable finish.  Yep, you probably guessed it\u2026 PASS ON THIS ONE!  I think I\u2019d rather mow grass than smoke another one of these.Pre-Light: 8 pts. Smoking: 3 pts.

For the more novice smoker, as the name suggests, they are comprised completely of tobacco gown in Nicaragua.Readers of my reviews might recall that I have not been a fan of Alec Bradley cigars.  I wasn\u2019t particularly fond of the Prensado where I completely disagreed with the \u201cCigar of the Year\u201d distinction it had received from Cigar Aficionado magazine and I was just as unimpressed with the Black Market that I also reviewed for this site.However, as a lover of cigars and always willing to try the latest product I decided to pick up a couple of the firm\u2019s newest release, the Nica Puro. I decided to give it a whirl because as of late I have enjoyed the tobacco coming out of Nicaragua.Appearance :  The Gordo is a BIG cigar.  With a hefty 60 ring gauge, it barely fit in my guillotine cutter and boasting a length of 6.2 inches, it felt really heavy in my hand.   The band was stylish and as seen in the photos, the wrapper had a very toothy appearance with visible veining and tight seams.  The wrapper had a nice sheen to its dark brown color with some visible reddish spots.Construction :  As you can see in the photos, the cap looks a tad sloppy in its application.  The cigar was firm to the touch with a few lumpy, harder sections noticeable.    However, the burn of the cigar was unaffected by the considerable veins and the lumpy areas.  It remained extremely even and razor sharp.  The Nica Puro needed no touch-ups or re-lights.The cigar took a few double puffs to keep it going at the beginning, with smoke output quite muted.  However, as I approached the 2nd third, these issues were gone with the draw becoming much easier and with no double puffing needed to get a good mouthful of smoke.  The smoke at this point was nice and thick and remained that way for the rest of the smoke.The band is huge and it was difficult finding the seam.  Thankfully with a little wiggle I was able to loosen it and slide it off quite easily without damaging the wrapper.The ash was very firm with no flaking. In fact it held firm on the cigar for over 2 inches before I tapped it off, not wanting it to accidentally fall off onto my clothes.Flavor :  (4.25) The pre-light aroma was barnyard mixed with rich natural tobacco, sweet cedar and a hint of some citrus.   The pre-light draw provided hints of leather, coffee, sweetness and slight spice with a mild hint of citrus.Because of the cigar\u2019s size, I made sure to give the foot a nice toast before putting my flame to it to ensure that the cigar was evenly lit.  It gave off a very pleasing rich tobacco scent.  The first few draws were more about getting the cigar going than anything else.  However, after a few double puffs, I was able to get some decent smoke output.The first third had some nice spice on the finish. The front of the palate had some toasted nuttiness, hints of sweet oak, leather and some pleasing creaminess.  The smoke\u2019s texture was nice.  Not too creamy or oily but just enough residue to be able to taste a hint of caramel and get some of that creamy sweetness from smoke that I personally enjoy.The cigar did not change much for the first and second thirds but it did have a good blend of flavors that came in and out of the cigar.  It continued to give off hints of sweet woodsy flavors, occasional hints of dried fruit, leather and nuttiness with some roasted coffee on the front of the palate with a touch of salt on the lips.  There were occasional chocolate notes ranging from semi-sweet to more cocoa like.  It seemed every couple of puffs gave me something different.  I must say, not being a fan of the Alec Bradley cigars, this one had me intrigued.As I approached the halfway point, much of the spice had subsided but was still there at the back of the palate in a much more subdued amount. The cigar took on a more chocolaty essence but the underlying earthiness and nuttiness of the cigar was ever present.  The smoke was considerably thicker and hints of leather and sweet wood continued to come through in the profile. By this point the draw had opened up nicely with thick plumes of smoke that continued to have a slightly sweet residue on my palate.  The tobacco left a slight hint of salt on my lips.  Overall up to this point the cigar was extremely well balanced.Jut past the halfway mark I got some dark chocolate, roasted coffee, slight hints of toasted caramel and the smoke output actually took on a creamier 'chewy' texture. There was a slight increase in the woodsy notes, going from a fruity oak to a sweet cedar.At the halfway point the cigar continued to impress with subtle but noticeable changes in flavors. Some nuttiness, unsweetened espresso, roasted coffee bean and leather.The spice was all but gone and it never did return. The finish became slightly shorter and a tad bitter, like an unsweetened espresso.  Admittedly, the final third lacked much of the sweetness previously present.The cigar ended with more muted flavors, remaining earthy, leathery and woodsy with subtle unsweetened chocolate and unsweetened espresso notes.I was admittedly tired after smoking this cigar for 90 minutes but I never felt any nicotine effects. I would rate the strength as medium and the cigar itself was medium to full bodied with much of the bold flavors in the first half transforming into a more medium bodied cigar in the second half  with the flavors becoming more subtle.I gave the flavor a rating of 4.25.  I felt the spice that helped compliment the sweeter notes of the cigar faded far too early.  Also, I did not particularly enjoy the bitter notes of dark chocolate and unsweetened espresso later on in the cigar.  I felt that they took away from the sweeter tone of the cigar.  They didn\u2019t last long but they were noticeable nonetheless.  Also, the flavors subsided in the final third to such a degree that the cigar became a tad musty and too woodsy and grassy compared to what I had smoked up to that point. Overall though, given the newness of this cigar, some humidor time would certainly help it. I would definitely smoke one again but not in this size.  I will touch on this later.Value :  I paid $8.50 for this cigar.  For a 90 minute smoke it was, in my opinion, worth the money but still, I believe that this company can pass on some savings to the consumer by doing away with a lot of the glitzy packaging and advertising that always gets factored into the pricing.Overall Rating :  (4.30) I despised the Prensado and the Black Market and I really didn't expect much from the Nica Puro but they hit the mark on this cigar and made a very enjoyable stogie with great complexity and enjoyable flavors.

Born in Venezuela of Italian descent, Di Fazio is a self-described dreamer who loves to smoke cigars.As others have noted, Di Fazio cigars are rolled at Fabrica de Tabacos Raices Cubanas S. de R.L. factory in Honduras. That factory also makes Illusione and Alec Bradley Tempus cigars, among others.They also offer the Picoso, which has been previously reviewed on Cigar Inspector and the Connecticut.Appearance :  The dark chocolate brown wrapper shows some veins but it does not detract from the appearance of the cigar. The wrapper displayed a nice oily sheen. The mostly white band with gold accents is an interesting contrast to the wrapper and is attractive.Construction :  This is a well-packed, nicely constructed cigar with zero soft spots. The maduro wrapper is Nicaraguan. The binder is Honduran and the filler is Honduran and Nicaraguan. The pre-light draw was excellent. The cap was done well also. There was one small hole in the wrapper of my second cigar but this may have happened in shipping or my humidor.

The ash was slightly flaky and gray-white and held on for a couple inches.Flavor :  The smell of the cigar pre-light was sweet, like dried fruit and chocolate. Initial taste was sweet with a hit of pepper in the back of the mouth. I detected some pepper on the retro. The first third I noted tastes of coffee and hickory with plenty of thick rich smoke.  The second third the hickory taste went to the background and I tasted more coffee and burnt chocolate. The last third kept the same basic profile while increasing the pepper a bit. The retro-hale was spicy but not overly so. There was always a pepper note at the back of the throat.  It was a medium to full bodied smoke.Value :  At $8 per cigar this is a decent stick. The flavors are nice and fairly complex. This is a competitive price bracket.  If you can find them in the $5-6 range it is a definite buy.Overall Rating :  I enjoyed this cigar overall. I liked the sweet smell and flavors. The construction was good despite what may have been some self-inflicted problems I had on my second cigar. I smoked 3 overall and the flavor on all three was consistent.  I recommend trying one or two to see if it's for you. As usual though, your mileage may vary.Hickory? Chocolate??

It\u2019s a fact and the Chubbys are proving it. This is one of the first 60 ring gauge cigars. We\u2019ve been making it since 1995. The Chubby Maduro is a full bodied smoke, with a dark and shiny Dominican Maduro Special (DMS) wrapper developed by us. The Chubby Natural is absolutely gold, both in color and in the distinctive mild taste.(Excerpt from the Cuban Stock Website).Beautiful day outside, perfect for a smoke. Unfortunately, I have a lot of errands to run, so there is only one solution. Smoke on the road. I pick out a beautiful Torpedo and immediately members of my family begin begging for some too. Briefly I consider delving into my traveldor in search of White Owls, but realize I haven\u2019t allowed something like that into my case in ages.  Grudgingly I hand out three of my precious sticks and begin my preparation.The smell of this cigar is amazing, there\u2019s something earthy, dark, and oily in the smell. The wrapper is a gorgeous shiny dark brown, bordering on black, with just hints of redness.  The cigar itself is very firm, almost seeming too tight. I snip the end and do a test draw. Absolutely perfect, no blockage of any kind. I light the cigar and get just a touch of bitterness, that quickly passes as the burn moves on.  The cigar produces huge clouds of smoke, with a woodsmoke smell.  The taste of the cigar itself is a slight bit peppery, with tastes of cedar and hickory. The burn is even a the ash is a very clean light gray.  I continue on enjoying this cigar, the taste profile doesn\u2019t really seem to change at all, staying very consistent, with only variations in it\u2019s spice levels.  Do not light up one of these sticks if you are looking for a quick smoke.  I am known to smoke my cigars too quickly, and this still lasted me two hours easy.  When I had about two inches remaining the wrapper began to peel and unroll.  This is the only problem I encountered with this cigar, at least until I was done.After putting the cigar out I ran into my second problem. I was extremely dizzy, and felt more than a touch queasy.  The last time I felt a cigar this strongly was one time that I had a La Flor Dominicana Double Ligero on an empty stomach.  There should be a warning label on this stick. Do not approach if you have not fortified yourself with a heavy meal.  I had a full meal and it still proceeded to beat me up and take my lunch money.  By no means do I want you to avoid this cigar, in fact I highly recommend it.  You should just be aware this is not a beginner's cigar, it is for someone who has developed a taste for stronger sticks.  If you like LFD\u2019s and similar sticks, this should be on your must have list.Agent 86 out.  I have a couple of these beauty\u2019s left that I can actually age this time. I would like to say I\u2019m going to revisit these in a year, but I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019ll have to have another one within the next two months.Update: I was informed by Cuban Stock that I forgot to mention how smooth this cigar is. I actually agree with them, that is an important piece of info. There is no harshness at all to this cigar, it is very smooth, which makes the power of this smoke that much more surprising.This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents.

Along with that success, it also carries a reputation of being hard to find. I provided a bit of background on the Hemingway cigars in my review of the Best Seller so rather than rehash all of that here I will just dive right into this cigar.In my experience, the Classic seems to be the easiest to find of all the Hemingway vitolas. Classic is a good label for this smoke too. That is how I\u2019d describe it. It\u2019s a classic cigar experience, medium bodied and easy smoking. It has a classic tobacco flavor wrapped in a classic Cameroon sweet spice. It is a very enjoyable smoke if a bit one dimensional. It doesn\u2019t do a whole lot to excite the palate but when you are finished with it you find yourself saying \u201cThat was a damn fine smoke.\u201dThere is a warmness to the flavors that lends this cigar to a chilly day. Construction wise it is your typical Fuente product, very well made with a good draw. The cigar feels a little light for its size making you wonder if it\u2019s under filled, but there are no soft spots on the cigar to speak of. The wrapper is very toothy and very rough looking. It looks like you could use it to sand a piece of balsa wood. The burn would go a little crooked once in a while but it always managed to correct itself. If you find yourself in the mood to just drink in an abundance of classic Cameroon flavor, this is a stick you should consider reaching for.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

Cherry (a Litto specialty) and cocoa and leather without the dryness.There was a subtle nose spice that picked up now and then.This is the Zen cigar for sure- a great balance between flavor and strength, complex and gives you that mouthful of flavor that you get in the \u201csweet spot\u201d in most other cigars.This, however, is not the strongest cigar in the LFD stable, but makes up for it in flavor tenfold.The last half amped up the cocoa, and threw in some espresso with a touch of Habano musk!If every 8 dollar cigar was this good\u2026  My only real complaint was that the draw was pretty tight, and that\u2019s what kept it from an \u201cA\u201d rating.", "flavor": " The Air Bender Chisel has an aggressive flavor and body from the first draw.

Ambos Mundos cigars are produced by Pepin Garcia and are considered Johnson\u2019s value-priced line.  The full Ambos Mundos portfolio consists of eight different sizes/blends, although the official website shows only six sizes (have the Shorts been discontinued?).  They are as follows:On to the review\u2026The pre-light ritual for the Ambos Mundos Short No. 1 was just under perfect.  The cigar wore a nice light brown wrapper with minimal veins.  The cap was double seam and perfectly round.  The foot of the cigar was completely jam packed full of tobacco and the sweet smell of tobacco and honey was present.  The band was simplistic and did the job for this cigar (no need to be overly fancy on this size cigar).  The cold draw gave in to tastes of a woodsy, spicy mix with the perfect resistance.The opening of my Ambos Mundos Short No. 1 was wonderfully smooth with leathery, pepper flavors.  The cigar was full bodied right out of the gate with tons of thick white creamy smoke.  Burn was proving to be nice and even with a flaky ghost white ash, however the most intriguing thing was the cigar\u2019s aroma.  A nice musty antique book, that was put on a shelf and not opened for 30 years was spot on to the aroma of this cigar, and I very much enjoyed it!Into the second third the burn continued to be solid with the aroma still remaining amazingly euphoric.  The flavor profile of the cigar continued to be leathery however the pepper dissipated with woody notes now coming through on the palate.The final third of my Ambos Mundos Short No. 1 did not disappoint.  The cigar moved back in body to the medium/full range and prepared for a finish that showed tastes of hickory smoked wood and a little dryness.  The burn and aroma remained fantastic throughout the entire smoking experience and the draw spot on.For this cigar to be a \u201cvalue priced line\u201d cigar it was absolutely amazing.  Not an abundance of complexity present however the Ambos Mundos Short No. 1 was certainly a solid smoke with the performance (burn), draw, and aroma being top notch.  If you\u2019re looking for a quick afternoon or evening smoke this would be a great choice!  At this quality and price point I will certainly be buying a box of these in the future.

To make it more specific, the sweetness was felt primarily at the roof of the mouth, while the rest of the flavors were more directed towards the tongue.", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/la-aurora-107-1.jpg?iv=16"}, "dominico robusto": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Robusto Size : 4 3/4 x 52 Wrapper : Ecuadorian Connecticut Filler : Dominican Republic Binder : Dominican Republic Hand-Made Price : \u00a36.50 each", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "carlos torano", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["excellent review.

I have contributed to the Montecristo (Open Master, Open Regata and No. 5) and El Rey del Mundo Choix Supreme reviews predominantly, but also others.I would like to share my views on other brands which I sample, mainly drawn from my favourite stockist, Fox's of St James', London.  As a newbie, I think I can add something to the experience of other beginners, as reviews can, with time, become quite in-depth (rightly so) but would benefit from sharing a newcomer's take as well.I am particularly interested in being able to draw out cigars which may suit the palate of the beginner which will include bigger names with less demanding flavours and, crucially, other non-Cuban cigars which, on account of perhaps more modest pricing, may be more attainable on a regular basis.To this end, I'd like to start with the Fox's new, in-house brand, the Carlos Torano Dominico Robusto 1.The Carlos Torano Dominico series is marketed as a budget (non-Cuban) cigar and comes in a few vitolas of which two are readily available from my favourite stockist in St James', the Robusto and a Perla.The Robusto comes bundled in 25s and each cigar is cellophane wrapped.  The band is a \"plain\" narrow black paper with the word Dominico in yellow; there is no other indication on the wrapper.  The feel of the cigar is solid, delivering a gentle smell of tobacco with few overt notes.  The wrapper has a dry appearance but without the dusty feel of badly kept cigars, pleasant to the touch.I invariably use a punch for my cigars (Victorinox penknife with a bespoke 3 hole blade which comfortably covers 30-52 ring).  The punch leaves a clean hole, adequately deep with a clean edge which does not flake at all - perfect.  The pre light draw is clean and easy - despite the solid feel of the roll.  The construction is excellent, with no hint of the wrapper coming loose.The foot toasts perfectly, but needs quite some application (I put this down to the apparently tight roll) but the first couple of draws require minimal touch up.The initial flavour is quite sharp with lots of peppery tones.  These stay with the smoke for the first half of the cigar but at the same time, a rich sweet flavour develops but not achieving the rich chocolate quality of something like a ERdM Choix Supreme.By halfway, the peppery sharpness has left the cigar and the whole experience becomes one of mildness.  At this point I really enjoy just letting the full smoke waft around me, it does not conflict with the drink I have and I enjoy drawing the smoke back up to let it travel around the sinuses.  As a relative beginner, this offers all the enjoyment of a cigar taste without challenging me too much.  This is not a criticism, but rather a pointer that a beginner will enjoy this smoke at any time, whilst even the more seasoned aficionado would enjoy this early in the day or after a light meal where you don't want to loose other flavours.The smoke I just had was particularly pleasant; I allowed the stack to build deliberately to see how well it held and broke it after three inches!  I do believe it would have held further, this is testament to the construction.  The burn remained even throughout, I was able to put it down and retrieve it without any need for touch up.  There was absolutely no sign of the wrapper breaking away or unevenness in the stack.To sum up:  The Dominico Robusto is an excellently constructed cigar which delivers a gentle (undemanding sounds too negative in this context), smoke which begins quite peppery but becomes sweeter with time.  It is an ideal early cigar or one to complement the delicate flavours of a meal or drink.  Above all, it is an ideal introduction of this vitola to newer aficionados whilst remaining within a reasonable budget.Construction:  Flavour:  Value: ", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/carlos-torano-dominico-450x5461.jpg?iv=16"}, "arturo fuente short story maduro": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Format : Figurado Size : 4 x 46/49 Wrapper : Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro Binder : Dominican Republic Filler : Dominican Republic Hand-Made Price : $6.50More info about purchasing Arturo Fuente Short Story cigars...", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "arturo fuente", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": ["That is one hell of a pretty looking stick.

A graceful taper toward the head along with the pressed nipple foot give this diminutive cigar an elegant figuration. Yielding only very slightly to a gentle squeeze, it is evident that this Hemingway is rolled tightly and evenly. The prelight aroma is a dusty chocolate.The flawless draw on this perfecto facilitated a well-defined harmony of flavors. This cigar is characterized by its dominant slightly sweet and creamy flavors. Other flavors include hints of earthy chocolate, dark fruit, vanilla, and nuts. The Hemingway is smooth, well balanced, and refined; however, it is conspicuously lacking some complexity.With a smoking time of just under an hour, the Arturo Fuente Hemingway Short Story Maduro provided a refreshing set of distinct flavors well worth the modest cost.

I\u2019ll be up front. I am not a fan of large ring gauges. Quite often I find cigars with a 52+ ring to have muted flavors and iffy complexity. Not to mention they just aren\u2019t very comfortable to have in your mouth. I consider Coronas, Lonsdales, and Lanceros to be the ideal cigar vitolas, and consider them connoisseur sizes. That said I am a fan of the Padron thousand series cigars. Furthermore, it is the one line of cigars that I feel are better in their maduro version then they are in a natural wrapper. That is significant because those who have read my reviews know I\u2019m not a maduro fan as a rule either. So this particular cigar is a bit intriguing to me because I\u2019m curious what will win out with me, the fact that I like Padron maduros or the fact I dislike huge ring guages.Padron\u2019s maduro wrappers aren\u2019t very dark in comparison to most maduro wrappers. In fact, the maduro cigars in this line aren\u2019t much darker than the naturals and it can be hard to tell the difference without putting them side by side. The wrapper looks like rough leather with a slight tooth and oily sheen. The large cap put my Palio cutter to the test as it barely fit inside the blades, but it clipped nicely. It has a very light draw which I find typical with this line of cigars. I toasted the foot and it took the light nicely producing a nice even burn. The excessively large ring gauge makes it a little difficult to draw on and it feels very awkward in my mouth. I find this stogie kind of hard to smoke. Flavor-wise it is very much like its brothers but the flavors are more muddled compared to the 3000 and even the 5000. It is very leathery with a nutty undertone. The construction is typical Padron. A sloppy cap but otherwise perfectly made with a good draw, even burn, and a well formed ash. It is a good cigar, kind of easy going with a cool burn. Those that love the big fat stogies are going to really enjoy this stick. As for me, I find the ring gauge too large and as a result the cigar is an awkward smoke.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It is hand-made in Esteli, Nicaragua in four vitollas: Robusto (5.5\" x 52), Corona (5.5\" x 42), Torpedo (6.5\" x 54), and Churchill (7\" x 48); each of which are cellos with a thin cedar wrapping.  The capa is Nicaraguan grown Cameroon, the capote is Havana-seed Nicaraguan, and the tripa is a blend of Honduran and Nicaraguan.  Torano describes the 1916 Cameroon as being a, \"slow burning, well balanced, medium body cigar with distinctive hints of pepper, caramel, nuts, and sweet spice with a long, smooth finish.\"  The vitolla I smoked for this review was the Robusto.The 1916 had a very pleasant and sweet pre-light aroma with a color between colorado and colorado-rosado.  It had several lumps and bumps in the capa but no knots or hard / soft spots; however, there were some color inconsistencies with small greenish spots here and there.  It squeezed very firmly and judging by the foot, appeared to be well packed.  I made a straight-cut with scissors and tested the pre-light draw and taste which had pretty fair resistance and a slight bitterness at first which subsided right away and was followed immediately by a woody, sweet taste.  It took a little fire to get it lit well but I attribute that to the apparent well packed quality I mentioned a moment ago.  Once lit it began to burn very well and produced plenty of distinctive blue smoke with a noticeable woody taste.About 1/2\" in I began to detect a distinct pepper / spice tingle on the top 1/3 of the tongue.  Retro-exhalation was possible but had to be done gently, otherwise it would burn a little and trigger a cough.  As it burned it left behind a crispy, very light grey, almost white ash with a few dark spots which held on for the full first 1/3 before dropping off on its own.  Around the 1\" mark the distinctness of the pepper was still present but the tingle had mellowed and each puff was followed by a dry finish.  The middle 1/3 continued to mellow but still had some pepper notes and the dry finish while a mild woody taste developed on the lips.  Farther into the middle 1/3 the strength of the pepper re-emerged across the middle-top of the tongue and the ash dropped off again on its own with the full middle 1/3 and part of the last 1/3 (indicating good long-filler tobacco and skilled rolling).  The final 1/3 smoked with slight wood and pepper notes and the dry finish continued to the end.Overall, the Carlos Torano - 1916 Cameroon was a decent smoke.  From beginning to end it didn't require a single touch-up or re-light.  I thought it was going to need a touch-up a couple times but it corrected itself and continued to burn smoothly.  I didn't notice much in the way of complexity so it's not the kind of cigar you need to devote your full time and attention to; however, it struck me as being the kind of cigar that would be good with a beverage and while I smoked it, Macallan 12 year old single malt Scotch kept coming to mind, perhaps because its fruity nose and smooth taste would be a good balance and compliment to the wood, pepper, and dryness of the 1916.", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/carlos-torano-cameroon-1916.jpg?iv=16"}, "liga privada feral flying pig": {"overall rating": " It\u2019s early in the year, but this is already at #1 for top cigars for 2012 so far.

Smoke production is on a whole other level from many cigars. This one gives the smoker a thick blanket of smoke on the palate and sinuses which makes flavors easily discernible. The ash is a suede grey coloration and holds on for a very long time for such a large ring gauge.Flavor :  On the light and first few puffs, the Feral Pig is hitting all the right spots. Immediately displays some unique complexities and each puff seems to bring something different. A very small amount of pepperiness is noticed from the light, but quickly, I notice some sweet earthy flavors I usually get from Brazilian tobacco. The rum/cognac aroma of the smoke is hard to avoid since this thing burns like a road flare.1st Third: Syrupy sweetness, rum, a touch of leather, and some dirt accent the 1st part of the Feral Pig,\u2026 a very delicious start in my honest opinion. I am not familiar with Drew Estate's practices on aging their Unico Series wrappers, but they seem, at least to me, to have been aged in rum or cognac casks. I say this, because the aroma is so distinct in their sticks and smells similar to Anejo\u2019s from Arturo Fuente, which are aged in oak rum casks. Flavor profile is full but strength doesn\u2019t seem too bad and only feels like medium+.2nd Third: Some black pepper flavors seem to have crept in and cling to the back of my throat now. The smoke is pretty smooth and smokes like an aged stick. The syrupy sweetness continues through to this point now and some cereal/malt has joined the fray. Not as complex as the 1st third, but the cigar is still a thrill with the amount of thick smoke that coats the sensory organs.3rd Third: *Cough,\u2026 cough*,\u2026 the strength has caught up to me now. The body of the Feral Pig is full blown and this cigar is starting to kick my ass. Flavors are ramped up nicely now providing a memorable conclusion to the stick. \u201cFeral\u201d pretty much sums up the wild flavors that seem to have appeared. A large amount of spiciness has started to cling to my throat. The flavors end with amped spicy sweet beef jerky, chocolate malt, dirt, earth, and mushroom like flavors.WARNING: Smoke at your own peril!Value :  I am going to go out on a limb and say this cigar is well priced. Yes, I know, it $15+ dollars. But in its defense, it smokes for 2+ hours, is jam packed with flavors, is a uniquely shaped stick, is beautiful to look at, burns perfectly, goes well with your favorite rum, cognac, or scotch,\u2026 and on and on and on,\u2026 I could keep going,\u2026 Hopefully you get the point :)Overall Rating :  It\u2019s early in the year, but this is already at #1 for top cigars for 2012 so far. I looooooooove this cigar! I wasn\u2019t that crazy of the Feral Pig's predecessors such as the No. 9 Flying Pig, which I reviewed for this website, nor the T-52 version. The shape in the other Pigs posed some awkwardness in smokeablility. The longer version seems to cure those problems. The burn in this version is much better and the smoke production is crazy. Truthfully the strength was more than I am definitely used to (or prefer usually) but with some time in the humi I think these issues will calm down. What\u2019s even better is that I believe there will be better numbers of these to go around for awhile. The Connecticut Broadleaf wrapper and Brazilian Mata Fina combo seems to complement each other beautifully, the wrapper lends a deep earthy core and the binder gives a punch of sweetness. All hail the Broadleaf, Drew Estate did it again!!! \u2018Til next time folks,\u2026 keep on smoking my friends.This post was written by Aaron.

They come in two wrappers:  the Ecuadorian Sumatra or a USA-grown Connecticut broadleaf.  This cigar comes wrapped in a copy of the front page of the New York Daily Mirror from the day the Cuban embargo started (1962).  In looking at websites that sell the cigar, it seemed that they do not use the newspaper wrapper anymore.  The Exile Rosado comes in a few sizes:  Perfection No. 1 and No. 2 (both perfectos); a Robusto, and today\u2019s featured cigar, a Churchill.Appearance :  As the name implies (rosado), the cigar is a reddish-brown color.  One can see 1.5 veins running the length of the cigar.  The wrapper looks dry, and it did not exhibit any oily sheen.The cigar had a soft spot roughly at 2.5 in. from the head.I smoked two cigars prior to writing this review, and one of them did not have a band.  The other one had a very nice large olive green band with cream trim around it.  The word \u201cExile\u201d was listed in very large dark gold letters.  The seal of the \u201cRepublica de Cuba\u201d (Republic of Cuba) was stamped in the cigar along with a black stamp that said \u201checho a mano\u201d or handmade.  This is a very nice label, and I wish both cigars had it.  I did due diligence and looked for the band for the cigar that did not have one inside the newspaper wrapping, but I was unsuccessful.Construction :  The cigar is single-capped, and no visible flaws were observed around the cap line.The ash was predominantly white with some black spots around it.  It also also loose and flaky.  A quick tap at around 1.25 in. was all that was needed to remove the ash.The cigar did develop an uneven burn and a canoe halfway through the smoke.  I used the quick method of flash burning the unlit portions to fix it.  This is not the recommended method to fix a canoe problem, but it did not seem to affect the flavors experienced in the cigar.The cigar was fairly smokey with the smoke rising and dissipating very quickly.The band on the cigar that was banded came off very easily.  No part of the band remained stuck to the cigar.Flavor :  The scent of the wrapper was floral and grassy; the foot seemed to have a more pronounced sweet smell (kind of like a honeysuckle).  It also feature a grass note to it.A Boston Cigar Company \u201cLittle Guy\u201d V-cutter was used to cut the cap.  In my opinion, this is the perfect size to use this cutter.  It is a very nice cut which exposes the correct surface area for a good smoke. During the pre-light draw, it felt like notes of honey were the primary taste.  The draw seemed a bit tight during pre-light; however, during the actual smoke, it was very good.  I am not sure what can caused such a difference although it may have been a perception that it was tight draw during the pre-light as oppose to the smoke.The taste and retrohale felt like roasted nuts, and after an inch or so, roasted coffee was noted.  Halfway through the cigar, a chemical taste was perceived; this can be best described as a nail polish (not acetone, but ethyl acetate).Value :  This is a good cigar for about $6.25 per stick.  A canoe effect was experienced in one of the cigars, so for the money, you get a fairly pleasant smoke.  Quite honestly, the chemical taste of what seemed like nail polish did not bother me too much as it was more of a hint although I would not like it if it was more pronounced.Overall Rating :  I never had the pleasure of smoking an Exile cigar before, and the first (and second) times were a very good experience.

Re-released in 2010, El Baton cigars are available in three different sizes; Robusto 5 x 54, Double Toro 6 x 60, and Double Torpedo 6 \u00be x 54.  Each size comes packaged in cabinets of 40 or can be bought individually at your local brick and mortar stores.  This week's review will be on the double torpedo and I\u2019ve only heard/read great things about this cigar.The El Baton had quite a hard start with a very low pre-light score.  The cigar was very thick/hearty with a veiny dark wrapper.  I found many construction issues with the cigar\u2019s wrapper.  Lots of bruises, black spots (looked like tar), very sloppy/wrinkled cap, and glue marks at the foot(???).  The band was very retro and new age with blue, gray, and black lettering that was almost holographic.  The El Baton pre-light smell was a strong manure, and the cold draw showed firm tobacco flavors.  Lastly, the cigar did not want to light very well.  This could be due to the girth of the stick but no matter what the case proved to be an inconvenience to me.During the first third of my El Baton Double Torpedo my palate was tickled with a burnt toast flavor and faint signs of tea.  The draw was decent but proved to be airy near the end of the first third.  The burn line was wavy and the ash a splendid solid white.Heading into the second third of my El Baton the taste profile turned musky with a hint of mint in the aroma.  The draw could be defined as much too airy and the burn quality only worsened.  The smoke was cold and thin and I felt as if I was working much too hard to smoke the cigar.  We all know my feelings on working to enjoy a cigar\u2026 YOU SHOULDN\u201dT HAVE TO!Well, the finish was about as exciting as the first and second thirds of the cigar\u2026 bland and un-eventful.  I will not buy this cigar again and do not recommend it to any of my readers however I do believe this proves a great point in being that all palates are different.  Personal preference is a huge part of cigar smoking and that\u2019s one of the reasons I love it so much.

Enjoy!Late last week I received two samples of the ORTSAC 1962 from Victor Vitale of The Cigar Agency. From the product literature and their website, I learned that \"The Cigar Agency is a manufacturer, importer and distributor of premium of cigars and cigar accessories.\" The ORTSAC 1962 is listed as their premier brand. It has been aged for five years and is hand rolled in the Dominican Republic. They are distributed in cedar sleeve of 72 inside a U.S. Army ammunition box, which can be used as a humidor.  (Imagine packing that to your next herf. HOOAH!)Appearance :  The ORTSAC 1962 has a very nice Chocolaty Corojo wrapper. Each sample had some prominent veins but nothing excessive.

I had more than 2\" going on the second sample before I decided to tap it. The initial light was without issue using my table lighter. The burn was very consistent and sharp.Flavor :  The pre-light flavors were indistinct, other than tobacco. Once lit I had a burst of sweet spice which quickly faded. Through the first and second thirds the flavors were earthy and cedar wood. Then like a switch had been flipped the sweet spice came back with full force through the remaining third. The spice really kicks up and lingers on the front of the tongue. As for body, I'd say it was mostly medium to mild.Value :  The price of these cigars is right on. Although not highly complex, the experience is well worth the purchase.Overall Rating :  The ORTSAC 1962 really impressed me.

However, I hold a slightly different impression of this cigar. I met Victor Vitale at a rolling event in Clifton Park NY on 5/29/09, the day after Michael submitted his review. I purchased 6 of these sticks at that time at $6.80 each. My first impression of Mr. Vitale was that he was a tad arrogant for a guy that sells cigars. While that hardly impacts the quality of the cigar, it left a bad taste in my mouth before even lighting up.After allowing the cigars a day to rest in my humidor I lit one. I completely agree with Michael\u2019s review regarding the construction of these cigars as being well made, except for the wrapper\u2019s \u201clight velvet pelt\u201d. Evidently this is accomplished by rolling the wrapper inside-out with the smooth side of the leaf on the inside. The rough texture became annoying to my lips before reaching the half-way mark.The burn was very good with a medium fine ash, and the draw almost perfect.Now onto the taste portion: I found it almost as disappointing as most Macanudos with only hints of body and spice and it left me with a craving for another full-bodied cigar. Since Michael received these as samples, I would say that price is right on, but I can think of at least two dozen cigars in the $7 range I would much prefer. I consider them to a solid $4 cigar. They will be relegated to my \u201cyard work\u201d smokes and certainly not as an enjoyable after dinner smoke. In my opinion if The Cigar Agency considers the ORTSAC 1962 as as their premier brand, they have much more work to do.Respectfully,", "flavor": " The pre-light flavors were indistinct, other than tobacco. Once lit I had a burst of sweet spice which quickly faded. Through the first and second thirds the flavors were earthy and cedar wood. Then like a switch had been flipped the sweet spice came back with full force through the remaining third. The spice really kicks up and lingers on the front of the tongue. As for body, I'd say it was mostly medium to mild.", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/ortsac-1962.jpg?iv=16"}, "partagas benji menendez master series": {"origin": "Origin : Dominican Republic Factory Name : Robusto Size : 6 x 46 Wrapper : Cameroon Filler : Dominican, Nicaraguan Binder : Habano Connecticut Hand-Made Price : ~$9 each, ~$179 for a box of 20More info about purchasing Partagas Benji Menendez cigars...", "overall rating": " I like this cigar quite a bit.

His grandfather, father, uncles and great uncles were considered the royalty of the cigar business during the pre-revolution heyday of Cuban cigars, having developed world-class puros including Montecristo, H.

Enjoy!In the same league as the Holy Grail and Shroud of Turin, the Holy Lance is considered a relic of Jesus Christ. Believed to be the spear that pierced Christ's side as he hung on the cross, according to legend, Constantine the Great (the first Christian Roman Emperor) carried the weapon in battle. Some believe that Hitler pilfered the Holy Lance and ordered it to be hidden in Antarctica, where it remained until being retrieved by European Nazis in the seventies.Since it is impossible to track down the current whereabouts of the Holy Lance, we will just have to examine the Dion Giolito blended Illusione ~ hl ~ the more user friendly Holy Lance.Illusiones are gorgeous sticks with impeccable construction, and the Holy Lance is no exception. The cap is topped off with a little tip to approximate the lance look, but not in a gimmicky way. The illusion is a nice touch that illustrates the thought Giolito puts into his craft. Of course, the stick is clipped so effortlessly you may not even get a chance to appreciate this refined touch.Like any tightly rolled cigar with such a small ring gauge, the draw on the Holy Lance can be very difficult at times. Couple that with the fact that the cigar does not so much burn as elegantly smolders and you end up with a smoke that will go out if you fail to give it the attention the cigar so richly deserves.The flavors introduce the palate to toasty cedar from the get go. The flavor remains consistent until just around the start of the second third, where smokey flavor starts to linger on the back of the throat. At first this almost pleasant sensation is nice, but as the cigar burns down, the smokey flavor becomes burnt and lingers longer. With a good two inches left, the burnt flavor dominates everything else. It is frustratingly difficult to subdue this taste, even with a full flavor drink.Of all the Illusiones I have sampled, the Holy Lance seems the most accessible for inexperienced smokers. This is not to say that the ~ hl ~ is weak or flavorless, but for a smoker who is eager to get their feet wet with more nuanced flavors and robust body, the Holy Lance would be a good place to start. Highly recommended.*Sigh*", "flavor": "N/A", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/illusione-hl.jpg?iv=16"}, "padron serie 1926 no 1 maduro": {"origin": "Origin : Nicaragua Format : Double Corona Wrapper : Nicaragua Filler : Nicaragua Binder : Nicaragua Size : 6.75 x 54 Ring : 54 Hand-Made Price : ~$20 eachMore info about purchasing Padron 1926 cigars...", "overall rating": " This is one of my favorite cigars among the expensive sticks.

Life happens and with a wife, a dog, and two small kids my free time is nearly non-existent.  So I was very surprised when I walked into my local shop after being gone for a while to find these new Hemingways sitting in the humidor.  I guess I have fallen a little out of touch.  After letting them sit in my humidor for the past month I am ready to spark this thing up and see what we have here.I know very little about this version of the Hemingway.  Is it a one time deal, a very rare release, or only somewhat rare like the Maduros?  I have no idea but I bought a couple just in case I never see them again.  Glad I did.  the Rosado wrapper is a nice change-up for this smoke.  The Signature Maduro is probably my all time favorite Hemingway Series cigar.  I like this size and the Maduro wrapped version is just spectacular.  The Rosado is nearly as good in a completely different way.  It has a mild spice with a touch of cinnamon in there, all stacked on top of a core of leather and wood.  I even picked up some subtle flashes of what I\u2019d describe as applewood at times.  It is a smooth medium body smoke and a real treat.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I give 3 stars for decent sticks and this cigar landed right in that area. There is a lot of things I don\u2019t particularly care for in this stick (band, packaging, appearance), but the cigar did bring some good interesting flavors to the foray. And for that much I would recommend this to others, but it just doesn\u2019t cut it for me particularly, especially for the price point. I believe the sub-5 dollar range would be a better bargain for this brand. After smoking this though, I would definitely not be put off to run down and try some of Augusto\u2019s other lines.

It did not last for long and the flavors started to drop off the farther I got into the 1st third. The second third transitioned to more of a charred oak and wet paper flavor with still a hint of some underlying tamari still. I smoke my cigars pretty fast and the first few samples became pretty hot into the last third of the cigar. This was not the case when I slowed up on my puffing on the last sample. The leather flavors sometimes cam e back in the last third but this was inconsistent throughout the smokes.

The Opus X line of cigars has garnered a lot of accolades since its introduction in 1995. Opus X cigars routinely score in the 90\u2032s in Cigar Aficiando and Cigar Insider. That combined with some aggressive marketing and limited supply has led to a whole lot of hype surrounding this scarce stogie. They sport a Dominican grown, reddish brown, Rosado wrapper which in the case of the petit lancero is a little veiny and lumpy. The wrapper for these Dominican Puros is grown on the Chateau de la Fuente Estate in the DR and is reported to be cured in rum barrels. Once the cigars are rolled, they are aged for a year before being sent to market.This particular cigar is a short and slender lancero with a tapered head. I love lanceros. I think they are a connoisseur\u2019s size and if done right make for some of the most complex smokes you can get. Its small ring gauge that leaves no room for error though as there isn\u2019t enough room in them to hide substandard tobacco. The Opus X Petit Lancero starts off a little peppery but settles down quickly. It\u2019s smooth with lots of caramel, and earth with a leathery finish. It is very complex medium to full bodied smoke. I expected it to pack a stronger punch than it did though. The buzz factor was nice but not the reputed knock you to your seat strength I heard and read from others. The flavors are very well defined making for an amazing smoking experience. The construction is excellent, with a perfect draw and a razor straight burn. Those two things are not easy to accomplish when making such a small ring gauge, and it is a testament to the skill of the rollers the Fuentes have making these cigars. The ash was so well formed, it looked like a little piece of concrete hanging off the end of the cigar. Even though I was a little disappointed with its power, this is the best of all the Opus X vitolas I have tried so far. I am afraid its price tag relegates it to a special occasion smoke though.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

To get one you would have to attend a Tora\u00f1o event where they were fresh rolled for the events attendees. The cigar was so well received by those lucky enough to smoke one that they decided to put this cigar into regular production. That is the story of how the Casa Tora\u00f1o cigar came to be.Sporting a silky smooth shade grown wrapper the Casa Tora\u00f1o is a handsome looking cigar. Typical of a Tora\u00f1o cigar, the construction is excellent.  Well filled with a perfect draw, it burns evenly and produces a nicely formed firm ash.  From the first draw the Casa Tora\u00f1o is smooth and creamy.  It has a woody core complimented by nuts and leathery notes.  There is a subtle sweet undertone and has a slightly bitter, leathery finish.  It is very mild at first but builds in body and strength as the smoke progresses.  You really need to take your time with this cigar.  I found that if you rush it, it can begin to burn hot and get a little bitter but if you take your time it rewards you with a smooth flavorful experience.  Its flavors are consistent and enjoyable from start to finish.  This cigar seems to be tailor made to enjoy with a morning cup of coffee.  I have had some good luck with mild cigars lately.  I had soured a bit on mild smokes for a while but the last few I have had have been very good and have warmed me to them again.  The Casa Tora\u00f1o is one of the best I\u2019ve smoked yet and can definitely see me smoking more of these, especially when I reach for a morning smoke.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

From the initial time I saw one I set to acquiring my own and although shortly after I realized that while they are not the easiest to come by, they are not really impossible to find.  Regardless, I was still excited to have purchased one and stored it away for a future time.  Recently, I had gotten over being sick and decided to celebrate with a smoke.The BTL\u2019s barber pole design is made up of a combination of Connecticut shade grown and Connecticut broadleaf maduro.  Several other companies and even Fuente lines have used the same design but the Hemmingway\u2019s figurado shape and perfecto tip lend it an even more distinctly appealing look.  The classic red Fuente Hemmingway band creates a perfect finishing touch to finish off a fine looking cigar.In classic Fuente tradition, little is known about the rest of the cigar\u2019s makeup beyond the fact that it is likely Dominican in origin.  The filler is very solid with little to no give, perhaps even a bit too firm and lacking spring.  The nose of the cigar is of sweet quality tobacco.  Cutting the head reveals a fairly tight draw, which is common amongst cigars utilizing the perfecto tip because of their very narrow opening.  Not much flavor is present pre-light.Upon lighting, the cigar proves to have a fairly dry mouthfeel and lacks an overwhelming amount of flavor.  After passing the perfecto tip, the taste opens up some and adds in sweeter notes of sugar.  Burning to the widest point of the cigar, the draw reaches a perfect tightness and hay becomes evident.  While unable to place it at this time, there is a very unique smell exuded when retrohaling, I only wish I am able to point out what it is because it is not at all unpleasant.  Shortly after this, the cigar becomes a little bolder with the addition of leather and cedar.After finishing out this cigar I am left a little disappointed.  While my expectations were high, I did try to keep them realistic.  The hay and tobacco at the onset was good but nothing exceptional and the cedar and leather, while rich, were too little too late.  I think if those two tones had been presented earlier on, the overall flavor profile of this cigar would have been higher.  Additionally, the more of the Hemingway line I sample, the more I am led to believe that the extreme figurado shape combined with the perfecto tip actually detracts from the experience because they cause too much differentiation in the draw.  This is especially true in such a short smoke where these types of changes are more apparent.  If given the choice between a Short Story and a Between the Lines I would choose the former every time.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (3.75)This post was written by Joe K.

Each year Don Carlos blends one size and his son Carlito blends a few others.  It is a very pricey cigar running in the $20 plus range.  In 2005 the Double Robusto was made by Carlito.  Sold in boxes of 10, the cigar is adorned in two ornate red bands.  The main band depicts the figure of Prometheus enduring his rather gruesome punishment for bring fire to the mortals.Each cigar is wrapped in a very handsome Cameroon wrapper.  The wrapper leaf is so good looking it is almost hard to believe it is a Cameroon.  It has very little tooth and appears very smooth with very tiny, very fine veins spider-webbed across its surface.  It has a very uniform brown color and has the appearance of expensive leather.  It also sports a massive cap.  I counted 4 seams spiraling around the head of the cigar.  Examining the foot shows perfectly bunch tobacco with a dark, oily spot dead center revealing the presence of robust ligero in its core.The God of Fire starts off smooth and creamy right from the start.  It has a very woody flavor complimented by a slightly sweet spice.  The smoke was amazingly smooth from start to finish.  Along the way I picked up notes of nuts and espresso.  The aroma had a hint of cinnamon in it and the last third was dominated by the original flavors of spice and wood.  The flavors were medium bodied and I considered the strength to be medium as well.  As for the burn and the draw, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a better constructed cigar anywhere.With a lofty name like God of Fire you might expect a powerhouse cigar but that isn\u2019t the case here.  The cigar is smooth and elegant and easy smoking.  It is a pleasure from start to end, but it does carry a very steep price tag relegating this cigar to primarily be a special occasion smoke.  It is certainly something every cigar smoker should try at least once.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

The Hemingway Maduros always make an appearance on tobacconists shelves every year around the Holidays.  The particular cigars for this review are from the 2008 run.  The Classic seems to be one of the harder to find vitolas of the Hemingway Maduros.  At least I rarely ever see them.  More common at the shops in my area are the Signature Maduros and Works of Art Maduros.  Even the Hemingway Between the Lines seem to be more common around here than the Classic Maduro.I smoked two of these cigars for this review because I wanted to see if what I thought of the first one I smoked would remain consistent with another sample.  The second cigar was identical to the first.  The Classic Maduro has a dark leathery wrapper.  Construction is impeccable, the burn perfect and it produces a ton of thick white smoke.  It is a decently complex smoke with a heady aroma.  The flavors are well balanced and defined.  Rich creamy notes complimented by leather and a musty earthiness and a slight maduro sweetness.  The only thing I can say that is markedly different about this cigar is that the larger size makes for a longer smoke.  I always enjoy these cigars whenever I smoke them, but I feel the flavor profile is particularly well suited to the cold weather of the season.  A cozy spot in a comfortable chair with a nice hot cup of coffee or even a hot chocolate makes for a great smoking experience with this cigar.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It had a Colorado shade wrapper that looks to be of high quality and didn't have many large veins or blemishes.  It also had a pleasant, slightly sweet prelight aroma.  This pyramid was firm to the touch, especially at the tapered head.Construction :  A well made cigar, no draw or burn problems.Flavor :  This cigar was started out creamy and smooth with some grassy and nutty flavors present, definitely mild.

And why not, he picked a master blender to make it for him. At the time this master tobacco blender wasn\u2019t well known. He had a small factory in Miami that employed just 12 rollers. This man would quickly become the hottest name in cigars. That\u2019s right, the Padilla Miami 8/11 was made by Jose \u201cPepin\u201d Garcia. The 8/11 in the name denotes location of Pepin's factory near the corner of 8th and 11th in Miami. I did say \u201cwas made\u201d because Ernesto and Pepin have recently parted ways, and now Pepin no longer makes any cigars for Padilla as Pepin\u2019s business has continued to explode and he had to devote more resources towards maintaining his own products. That means the Miami 8/11 as it has existed is going away so if you are a fan, you will want to buy up as much of these as you can because the Pepin Garcia version of this stick will no longer be produced.Wrapped in a typical Pepin Corojo leaf, the Miami is rustic looking with puckered veins and bumpy look. It is the color of milk chocolate and has an oily sheen. It has a strong almost pungent odor of tobacco and wet earth. Packed full of tobacco this Churchill has a nice heft to it, firm its entire length. The triple cap clipped nicely revealing a perfect bunch in the head of the cigar which mirrors the view from the foot.On the initial draw you get hit with a blast of pepper on the tongue but it quickly subsides. It is replaced by a rich earthiness with undertones of spice and flashes of caramel. It produces amazing thick clouds of almost snow white smoke and a room bouquet of toasted tobacco and floral notes. About half way through the Carmel and Spice have come to the forefront and it has a decidedly creamy feel. It has also developed a nice woody/cedar finish with a slight sweetness on the palate. The cigar begins to pickup in the last third. gone is the caramel and sweetness. It is all wood, earth, and pepper. It is very robust and full bodied.The Padilla Miami is a very well made cigar. The burn was even if not razor straight, and the draw provided just the right amount of resistance. It produced plenty of thick creamy smoke and produced a firm salt and pepper ash. In the past I experienced a lot of problems with the wrapper on this cigar being almost flame retardant and impossible to burn. I had no such problem with this cigar so perhaps those problems are a thing of the past. It is shame that this cigar is no longer being made.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Today, the Punisher is in the final production stages and currently available as part of a Cigar.com sampler.  All information about this cigar is closely guarded and its construction and resultant flavor is the result of a secret process.  But the alchemy that is taking place at Plasencia\u2019s factory is certainly working; as this cigar is exceptional is many ways.  Having now smoked a number of the current Punisher iterations, I am pleased to report that lovers of strong cigars have a great new addition to their smoking rotation.The original prototype of the Punisher was a hefty 6\u00d758 yet the final production cigar ended up as a slender piramide.  This bucks the current trend towards fat cigars and this change was simply the result of the manufacturers preference.  As it turns out, the 6\u00d752 torpedo shape fits comfortably in the hand.  Being a piramide, the overall look and feel of the stick is slender as the 52mm diameter is measured at its widest point (the foot).The Punisher wrapper has a toothy texture with a beautiful dark chocolate color and an oily sheen that is mouth watering.  Its prominent veins may not win points for presentation but its rugged appearance is a foreshadowing of big flavor and full strength.  This cigar looks like how it tastes.Although not billed as a maduro, the Punisher certainly fits the profile.  With a wrapper so dark, oily, and ripe, there is no other way it can be classified.  The Punisher is a sumptuous cigar with flavors of chili, dark chocolate, raisons, and rich ligero that has been fermented to perfection.  Its smoothness belies its strength, and the pre-lit spice serves as a warning: Newbies, beware!  I smoked a number of Punishers at various times of the day and my morning foray was interesting.  The ligero hit me early on and I had to ration the remaining cigar throughout to course of the day.  But the cigar tasted so good, I just didn\u2019t want to put it down.  This is definitely a cigar to smoke later in the day and with a full stomach.The concept of an infused wrapper might, on the surface, seem like a ploy to sell an inferior cigar.  But in this case, it serves as an augmentation of a great cigar that would otherwise stand on its own.  The creative minds at the Plasencia blending room (a joint venture with Cigars International) have taken the next logical step in the strong cigar evolution.  By coupling the spicy element of Nicaraguan tobacco with the physical sensation of heat, they have made a cigar that when smoked, is a total sensual experience.  Lovers of strong cigars and spicy food should truly enjoy the almost gluttonous experience of smoking the Punisher.  It\u2019s a very satisfying cigar, and with the addition of the \u201cchili effect\u201d, smoking the cigar is also a lot of fun.Note: If I were to compare the Punisher to another cigar, I would say that it tastes like a turbo-charged Rocky Patel Edge.  It\u2019s also important to mention that the amount of chili-heat varied from cigar to cigar.  Like a jalape\u00f1o, some Punishers were duds while others more intense.  But at it\u2019s strongest, the chili effect was never overpowering and its unpredictable nature was part of the fun.  One last thing: the burn was uneven and required some touch-ups, but it didn\u2019t diminish the enjoyment of smoking this cigar.  I think this may be a side effect of the wrapper having been treated but that\u2019s just conjecture on my part.This post was written by Robustojoe.

Dion Giolito of Illusione Cigars seems to be single-handedly championing a return of the Candela wrapper to premium cigars.  Once a mainstay of American cigar smoking, the modern smoker tends to look down on the green cigar wrapper as being too mild, near flavorless, or too grassy.  The truth is they are right.  Just about any candela wrapped cigar you find on the market today isn\u2019t very good.  It turns out that perhaps this is because no one bothers to put the wrapper on a good cigar.  That is until Dion started putting it on his Illusione cigars.  The first to get the green treatment was the lancero - the ~hl~ or Holy Lance.  Now you can also find the Candela on the very large ~888~ and the beefy robusto ~88~.When I saw the Candela ~88~ on the shelf and I was intrigued.  I hadn\u2019t tried a Candela wrapped cigar in ages and none I have ever had were any good, but this time the wrapper was on a cigar/blend that I knew I really enjoyed so I had to give it a try.  I was amazed.  The wrapper dramatically changes the cigar when compared to an ~88~ with its normal Nicaraguan wrapper.  It was crisp and smooth.  The Illusione core flavors of Earth and leather are still very much present, but they are expertly balanced with a slight sweetness and tea notes.  Later in the smoke I started to pick up a floral component to the flavors as well.  It was an amazingly good smoke, complex in flavor and visually interesting with its bright green wrapper.   This is one Candela that is certainly worth trying.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Sure, the common sense argues in the favor of this, but in the end, you can always change an ordinary day into an exceptional one, exactly by doing something special yourself \u2013 like, for example, smoking a Tatuaje RC 233.The RC233 is handcrafted with first-generation Nicaraguan seed tobacco.

The cigar has a subtle sweetness to it from start to finish that lays silently in the background. The first third is defined by flavors of coffee, nuts and a faint note of pepper. Progressing through the cigar, the only indicator that I have reached the second third is the visual clue, as the flavor profile remains almost unchanged.

It is, according to my research, the European version of the Rothschild, a 4 1/2 x 50 short robusto. Don't ask me why they wanted to change the name, perhaps it has something to do with the fact that the MSRP of the Epicure is approximately twice higher than the Rothschild. I will naively keep on thinking that the reasons of the price difference are high taxes and transportation costs - on to the review!Appearance :  I liked the looks of the Epicure - the Cameroon wrapper looks very authentic with a hint of plume. It has a pleasant tobacco smell, especially strong at the foot. It feels very sturdy and solid. The pre-draw is comfortable and earthy. \u00a0 Construction :  Not much to report. Easily lit it with a couple of wooden matches and the draw was perfect from the very beginning. The snow-white smoke was thick and soft. The burn needed no corrections.Flavor :  Prior to lighting this one up, I thought that I was going to get a nice medium-bodied smoke with woody and earthy flavors (I remembered a few reviews that I read some time ago). And... that's almost exactly what I got. The beginning is rather mild with a few sugary notes; 5 minutes later cedary flavors appear and dominate until the end of the second third. The final 10 minutes are under the earth sign, the earth/wood combination is quite tasty. Occasional cocoa and spice pleasantly dilute the bouquet.Value :  I paid over 7 USD for this stick and didn't feel ripped off. Considering the fact that the Rothschilds are sold for ~$90/box ($3.60/stick), our American readers should probably give those a try.Overall Rating :  Overall, it was another pleasant experience with the Arturo Fuente brand. The Epicures provide 35 minutes of nice smoking, perfect to relax a little bit after lunch, reading a magazine.

Towards the halfway point, a little bit of the spice comes back, but it is still drowned out by the woody tones. Then, all of a sudden, the flavor took a complete twist.

It is very well constructed. I only have checked out this first one and letting the others age. It was very smooth and lightly veined on the wrapper.. The wrapper was an oily dark almost black in appearance. According to the makers: \"Bahia Gold Maduro cigars feature a 4-year-old Connecticut Broadleaf Maduro wrapper, 4-year-old Dominican binder, and 3-year-old Dominican and Nicaraguan filler blend.\"Upon lighting it, the draw was very easy, the cigar itself was solidly rolled and I was surprised by how easy it did draw... it had a leathery taste and a hint of chocolate to it.. while it is supposed to be full-bodied either I am getting more conditioned to better cigars or this one was what I would consider more medium-full. It delivered an abundance of smoke and that was not surprising due to the easy draw.The ash held true and had to be knocked off but I could easily have kept it on almost down to the nub.Thoroughly enjoyable, I could not put it down and actually had to mentally remind myself to let some time elapse between each draw... it was THAT good.I am thinking of trying some of the other Bahias now that I have tried this one, but again I profess I am partial to maduros and this one I would not be hesitant or ashamed to give as a gift to anyone. As a matter of fact I have a buddy who is new to cigar smoking and I sent him a couple to try out. We will see what he thinks of them.Even though i just got finished I am already tempted to pull out another and light it up... If you have moochers that come around, slap one of these on them, they will think you accidently gave them one of your expensive sticks.It never turned harsh or bitter even as it got down to the nub though it did get a little stronger it by no means became less enjoyable...I have read reviews saying it tastes of coffee, caramel, pepper, and dry cocoa (I am not that discerning) and I would definitely give this a rating on the higher end of the point scale...Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value : With this stated, it is a great smoke, price COULD be better but it is still under $5 and if you know how to use a search engine and pay attention to deals you can find it much cheaper which would bump the value up to a 5.Happy smoke trails to ya!Are Bahias still in production?

Manufactured by Cuban Stock Cigars (previously known as Crown David).  The tobacco used in these cigars is said to be grown in soil that was transplanted from the Pinar Del Rio region of Cuba.First look at this cigar shows a deep reddish wrapper with just a slightly oily look. No prominent veins. The feel of this cigar is unlike any I\u2019ve ever had before, it\u2019s almost dry, with a really hard feel. There is no give to the cigar, it feels almost dry cured.  This worries me a bit as my past experiences with dry cigars were not good. On advice from a friend I use the cutter on this one. One must always circumcise a Crown David.  Being a Torpedo style shape I would have anyway. The cutting seems dry also. The smell is spicy and chocolaty at the same time.  It lights well and seems to burn very evenly.  The first taste throws my expectations out the window. A bit of spice but, lots of chocolate and coffee there as well. Very rich tasting.This flavor continues throughout the cigar.  The true surprise here comes a little past the halfway point, when I realize that the flavors have become far more pronounced and the strength is beginning to knock me back a bit.  It never becomes too strong to enjoy but it is a powerhouse nonetheless.As I reach the end of the cigar I find myself unwilling to let it go. However, the burning in my fingers convinces me that all good things must come to an end.  I find myself needing a lot of water and a good twenty minutes before regaining my ability to walk straight.

Yes I have chewed leather and yes I have tasted dry hay and grass. You don\u2019t have to go as far as me to build a palate though, you can just go by the aroma and flavors you pick up through retrohaling. I\u2019m sorry but taste is not just a sensory picked up by the tongue, but mostly by the nose. And the nose can decipher thousands of difference aromas and flavors. This is not BS but medical fact, I would know since I work within the medical  field. Next time in a middle of a nasty cold/flu, smoke a cigar and tell me what you taste. It\u2019s almost nothing, cause your sinuses are flooded with mucus and swollen. This is because you can\u2019t taste without the ability to smell. Every cigar reviewer worth his salt will tell you the exact thing. It\u2019s no different if you are a wine reviewer or connoisseur. Menthol is only menthol because of it\u2019s oily aroma, it hardly has flavor, that\u2019s why it penetrates the sinuses, why do you think people use it for colds.

I would probably go out on a limb and call him the cigar maker of the year so far for 2011. MATASA released the \u201cSeleccion Espana\u201d exclusively for B&M in Spain. Why only Spain and not the U.S.? I have no idea. Apparently they didn\u2019t think this would be a hit here at home. But the few stores that had the privilege of getting these sticks here in the United States got to see them fly off the shelves. Will they ever be released eventually in the U.S., time will tell.This review has been a long time coming. I bought a ten count box of these, and instead of writing a review when I got them I smoked almost all of them. So here goes,\u2026Appearance :  The Seleccion Espana is covered in a beauty of a wrapper leaf. The dark tan Arapiraca wrapper is minimally veined and has a nice oily sheen. The cigar is packed tightly and is perfectly cylindrical with no bumps along its outside. It has a traditional Cuban triple cap and smells of faint leather and graham crackers. I really like the banding on Quesadas, and this cigar is no different.Construction :  The Quesada cuts clean with no unraveling. The draw has a nice resistance to it. It lit quite easily with my single jet Xikar lighter. From there, it was cruise control. No touch ups. Burned it to the nub. Out of the 10 I smoked, only 1-2 needed any kind of touch up. Grey ashes held on for 2-3 inch chunks.Flavor :  No pepper, no spice, just everything nice. The Seleccion Espana started off with great honeyed flavor with a nutty backbone. The smoke is dry, but reminds me a lot of Montecristos from Cuba. The retrohale is where this stick shines though. The only drawback noticed is an acrid aftertaste on the smoke.In the second third, the Quesada continues to be an easy smoking experience with its smooth profile and clean burn. The body of the cigar is a solid medium. Graham and nuts tend to characterize this point in the cigar. A touch of leather can be tasted as well. The very noticeable cubanesque flavors from the 1st third of the cigar have been dialed back several notches.Continuing into the last third, things started to ramp up. The flavor profile is more \u201cin your face\u201d now with touches of menthol, leather, grass, and a hint of marzipan. Body remains medium, but flavor is full. Total smoking time was surprisingly long taking into consideration the short stature of this vitola.Value :  Boxes of 10 were being sold around $65 to $80 dollars for this vitola. In my opinion, the ten count box was a perfect release format not requiring people to make a huge commitment if it wasn\u2019t their cup of tea. The long smoking time made the price of this cigar easier to swallow making it a hit in my book.Overall Rating :  (4.25) The first and last thirds of this cigar were definitely the highlights of the Quesada Espana experience. It was elegant from the start and transitioned flavors flawlessly, rolling its sleeves up and showing a little bit of muscle in the end to let everyone know this cigar is serious. The Seleccion Espana is simply a well rounded stick with great balance and a little of that \u201ctwang\u201d that makes Cuban cigars so desirable. Hopefully everyone will have a chance to try this cigar someday. In the mean time, grab a brewski and smoke an Oktoberfest by Quesada!

The AVO LE 10\u2019s were available in boxes of 10 that used to retail for $150.00 a box. Today, these can only be found on the aftermarket.The pre-light ritual for my AVO LE 10 was harmonious.  One of the first things I noticed about this cigar was its smooth, dark, oily wrapper.  The double bands set well against the cigar with their brown, silver, and cream coloring however the lettering was splashed and sloppy on both bands.  The cap was very round but applied sloppy and the pre-light smell gave way to wonderful earthy, chocolate cocoa notes.  The loose airy draw was a little spicy and accented the cocoa that my sinuses found.The opening on the AVO LE 10 showed an effortless draw with a sweet chocolate and cream aroma\u2026 PERFECT!  The burn started uneven and the thick grey smoke led to notes of earth, cocoa, and black coffee on the palate.  The first third of the AVO LE 10 I considered to be somewhat of a \u201ccool smoke\u201d with its airy draw.With the first third being absolutely fantastic I was interested to see where this cigar would go from here.  Into the beginning of the second third I detected a faint change on the palate to nuts and almonds.  The burn remained uneven and the ash a powdery grey.  The earthiness remained throughout the 2nd third and the faint nut turned strictly to an almond character.With well over half of my AVO LE 10 gone I entered the final third a pleased man.  The beginning of the final 3rd had a little unpleasant burnt charcoal taste.  Upon removal of the bands the cigar\u2019s wrapper leaf tore and I noticed for the first time the excessive amounts of glue that had been used to apply both bands.  This caused me to have trouble finishing the cigar however I was able to pick up faint hints of what seemed to be graham cracker and caramel.To sum up the AVO LE 10 I would classify it as a \u201cgift\u201d cigar.  What I mean by this is, for my friends who are consistent cigar smokers I would not be embarrassed to give them this cigar as a gift.  We all understand that most occasional cigar smokers are appreciative of any cigar, however someone with a semi-refined palate would find the AVO LE 10 an interesting smoke.  The only regrets the cigar had was an inconsistent burn (had to touch up the entire time), and the falling apart of the cigar after removal of the bands.  I would have liked to experience those flavors I was getting before having to put it down\u2026 bummer.Pre-Light: 9 pts. Smoking: 7 pts. Overall Experience: 6 pts.This post was written by Kaleehb.

Without hesitation I purchased them. It has recently been brought to my attention that the Antano (Sp. Yesteryear) 1970 blend is to be discontinued and rebranded by Drew Estates under the Casa Magna band (see Norman's comment below). As such, I have been stockpiling this blend in its current incarnation as I am unaware to what, if any, changes are in store for this blend.Joya De Nicaragua (Sp. Jewel of Nicaragua) holds an interesting, if not prominent place in modern 20th Century cigar history. Tobacos Puros de Nicaragua S.A. was the first factory established in the fabled Esteli Valley region of Nicaragua. Consistently this region has produced some of the finest tobaccos and highest quality handmade cigars in recent memory. Founded in 1968 it was the cigar of Presidential Administrations in the years following the Cuban embargo of 1964. In the 70\u2019s its quality and flavor were renowned, considered to be the very finest in the world at that time, it rivaled Havana production during that period.Nearly brought to the brink of extinction during the Sandinista Revolution, it was returned to prominence and accolades in 2002. The Antano 1970 blend is a return to those bygone days of the 70\u2019s. By re-enlisting the master blenders and torcedors of that storied era for this project, Joya De Nicaragua has truly recaptured its former glory, providing for your enjoyment a genuine \u201cJewel\u201d, that is more than worthy of your time and attention.Appearance :  This cigar presents itself with total class and beauty.

Band is easily removed with no interference to the wrapper.Flavor :  The first third provided a first palette that is sweet, with flavors of cherries and raisin. It is producing generous volumes of gray white smoke. It possesses a precise burn and a wonderfully smooth and cool draw. Second palette is of sweet coffee and cream with an elegant aroma of cocoa and cedar. Closing out the first third is a rather full shot of nicotine that settles the stomach nicely.In the second third the first palette reveals a mild Scotch Bonnet pepper spice with notes of apricot and fresh almond. Second palette is of hot espresso. The tantalizing aroma of coca and cedar persists. Burn remains perfect with a light gray, tightly formed ash that holds strong to the body. The smoke being produced is luxurious and in pleasing volumes, yielding a cool and effortless draw.During the final third the first palette is leathery with red pepper spiciness with a second palette of Allspice and syrupy sweetness. The aromas and volumes of smoke from the preceding thirds are consistent. The draw continues to be spot on flawless. The finish is slightly bright, long and lingering with a smooth Cr\u00e8me de Menthe spice. It affords one many opportunities to revisit and reflect.Value :  With a price point from $7USD retail to Sub $3 wholesale it affords access to virtually anyone in search of a unique and very memorable cigar smoking experience.Overall Rating :  I was absorbed by this experience.

It is very tough to beat this cigar.  I give this cigar a Strong Buy recommendation.I know that this blend is aged for a considerable time before being released for consumption.  I am curious as to what a little more age might do in terms of developing additional finesse to its flavor profile. As I now currently own 4 full boxes of these I will let you know of my discoveries in the coming years. I wish to thank you for joining me on this journey. It has been a pleasure to share it with you.Pairing recommendations: I would advise coupling this cigar with Flor De Cana Centanarios 18 yr. old rum, neat.  This being sipping rum, any mixing of it would be criminal. Also I would recommend a quality hazelnut dark chocolate, as that would serve as a stellar compliment to this smoke, affording a truly luxurious experience.

Their name is Spanish and means simply, \u201cJourney.\u201d  Viaje focuses exclusively on crafting Nicaraguan puros.  The Viaje Oro Delicado is promoted as the fullest-bodied cigar in the Viaje puro line.  Measuring 6 x 50, the Delicado is a Toro with a consistent but enjoyable blend.Appearance :  The Viaje Oro Delicado is very pleasant to behold; the medium brown wrapper is almost veinless and has no noticeable hard or soft spots.  The somewhat heart-shaped band features the elegant Viaje logo with three tobacco leaves and a scrollwork border.  I can detect the smell of cocoa emanating from the wrapper before I light up.Construction :  The Viaje Oro Delicado\u2019s draw seemed a bit loose in the beginning but it self corrects and then is pretty much perfect from there on out.

The light sweetness from the citrus has almost disappeared and the cigar is producing much more strength, some pepperiness, and more body,... ultimately landing in the medium plus strength category.3rd Third- The finish on this cigar is fantastic. The cigar doesn't get harsh and muted but continues to deliver rich amounts of mixed cocoa and pepper. The strength is super sneaky and is full-bodied now without over powering my sensibilities.Value :  Simply said, this is a solid $10 cigar.

I expect anything from CAO to typically be spot on, whether it is the ever-favorite Brazilia, the MX2, or even recently the Brazilia Cuban Press, a new take on the original. Being that I do my best to stay abreast of new cigars coming into the public eye, I felt it was my duty to give  the La Traviata its owed time.Giving the La Traviata the physical look over, it became very apparent that I was looking a flawlessly made cigar. No flaws to be found on the Ecuadorian Habano wrapper. And speaking of the wrapper: it is oily! You can see it shine and feel the oil on your finger tips. Veiny too. No soft or overpacked areas were found within the cigar either. Finally, the band of the cigar has a very old world feel to it; nothing elaborate on the band design itself but it commands a certain amount of elegance. I felt it really completes the overall look and feel for what CAO was trying to achieve with this cigar.My first draw, after using a punch and my butane lighter, was greeted with an effortless, resistance-free draw. Immediate flavors that greeted me were a strong leather and a hint of wood. The oil from the wrapper added into the mix nicely, giving this cigar a balanced grouping of flavors without being overly powerful. As I ventured through the smoking time of this cigar, it does become noticeably stronger starting in the second half. I got an even larger presence of that leather flavor into the second half and by the last third, the cigar was well into full-bodied territory. Expect the finish on this cigar to be on the shorter side as the flavors didn\u2019t stay on my palette for more than a couple of hours.I had zero burn issues at all with this cigar. The ash from the cigar was firm and held to the end of the cigar well. And finally,  I felt I got a thick, white smoke from the easy draw. The thickness, I felt, was something to be proud of as it hung in the airspace of the room.I can say without reservation that this is my new favorite from CAO. A great balance of flavors with a very happy price point that anyone can appreciate. I would like to try out the other sizes to see if there is any discernible differences.

It didn't take me more than 15 seconds to cut & light the cigar and very soon I was enjoying ample clouds of white smoke. No specific complaints on the construction.

Why do so many cigar companies fail at the simple task of keeping their websites up to date?  It seems to be an annoying fact of life for cigar lovers who crave information.  Cigar companies seem loathe to part with it.Dressed in a dark brown leather jacket of a wrapper leaf it looks grainy and has small veins spider-ing across its surface.  The band is simple and elegant, and after clipping the excellently applied cap a quick test of the draw reveals perfection and a rich preview of whats to come.  Although there is none of the infamous \u201cPepin Black Pepper\u201d, the cigar is very Pepin-esque and leaves no doubt as to who blended this smoke.  The Nicaraguan tobacco seems to dominate at the start with lots of rich earth notes complimented by leather and coffee.  Once you get about half way in it starts to develop some Honduran spice and some nutty undertones of raw almond or maybe walnuts.  The last third is spicy and earthy with a slightly sweet finish.  I found this cigar to have an almost Tatuaje like nature to it which of course only makes me like it even more.  It is an excellent smoke and I enjoyed the size.  It is a convenient afternoon smoke and I plan to keep a handful of these in stock at all times.  I can see me reaching for one of these whenever I can\u2019t make up my mind on what I want to smoke.

In 2009 and 2010, Viaje really lit the U.S. on fire with some great small batch releases, with the Double Edged Sword being one of them. The last 2 years have been totally hit or miss for Viaje in my opinion. So for those of you that may still have these aging in your humidors, let\u2019s see how they are coming around.Appearance :  (4.25) The Double Edged Sword, or DES for short, is a double torpedo shape, hence the name of the cigar.

The smoke production is plentiful through the open draw. As for a lot of double torpedo-ish cigars I have smoked, this one was no stranger to the problematic burn. A few touch ups were in order to keep one section of the wrapper burning. Otherwise, there weren't many other drawbacks to construction.Flavor :  In the first two puffs I got hit with some peppery spice but it disappeared very quickly. I was then immediately met with rich leatheriness, meatiness, and soy/tamari flavors.The soy/tamari flavor was something that characterized many of the early releases of Viaje back in 2009 and 2010. Nowadays, the Viajes have lost that attractive flavor somehow.Not a whole lot changes in the second third if this cigar. There is a little less sweetness and more of a savory sensation. But the initial flavors are what continue to pull through up until now. The aroma is akin to the foot smoke off a Liga Privada Undercrown.In the last portion of this cigar, things have definitely been amped up. For an almost 2 year old stick this cigar still has a lot of punch. The body is definitely still full. A lot of pepper begins to appear with each puff, and dark chocolate and coffee bean get added into the mix with the initial flavors.Value :  When these were first introduced to the public they were $10.00. I'm sure if you find them on the aftermarket they are probably several dollars north of that now. That's if you can ever find them. I think this was a great price for a tasty cigar from a boutique that was in their hey-day. Nowadays their petit robustos may gouge you for $10.Overall Rating :  (4.25) This was and still is a great cigar. The first two years of Viaje were filled with such promise and this cigar along with the first Skull and Bones, and Holiday Blend release were top notch elite sticks. It's now rare that I smoke a Viaje that pulled as much weight as their early blends, but the company continues to produce fairly good stuff most of the time. The DES is not enormously complex but it is \"punch you in the face!\" delicious. Those that still have these lying around will be gleeful that they still have a great cigar on board.

A dozen of these were the Sol Cubano Series B\u2019s.  Being far more focused on premium smokes at the time, I stored these away in my humidor.  After gifting several of them to infrequent smoking friends and family along the way I discovered that almost everyone who tried them deemed it an enjoyable session.  While traveling recently, I had a failed attempt (underfilled) at my first PSD4 and the only other smokes with me were ones that I had planned on giving out, one of which was the Series B.  Thinking it the perfect opportunity, I broke one out in order to see what everyone was so pleased with.Previously, I mentioned that this smoke was selected because it was a backup to the PSD4 that I abandoned halfway through.  The irony of this is that after inspecting the Sol Cubano, it looks extremely familiar.  Grabbing the band from the PSD4, it strikes me that the Sol Cubano has to be an attempt to imitate the more widely sought PSD4 because the bands are almost identical with only two exceptions.  Obviously, the first exception is the printed name of the cigar.  The second is that the Sol Cubano band sports a bold blue field while the PSD4 is red.  Outside of that the font, line placement, and gold embossing are virtually identical.  On inspection, the wrapper of the Sol Cubano is well formed.  Caramel in color, the smoothness is marred by one sizable vein running the length of the cigar along with some spotting along the length.After a sharp cut, the prenotes are of sweet hay and a barnyard scent.  On lighting, the sweetness carries over and a mild tobacco flavor takes the lead.  The tobacco is not the most tasteful and is somewhat akin to cigarette tobacco.  The burn is slightly wavy but by no means out of control and remains consistent.  Following behind is an ash that is very light in color approaching stark white.  A loose composition fails to allow it to hang on for more than an inch throughout the entire smoke.  Continuing on, the flavor never really changes much.  At about the halfway mark the first real change occurs when a nuttier note joins the original sweetness.  The smoke finishes its last inch without much fanfare as it reaches a bitter point.Overall, I can see why the BOTL who gifted these recommended them as a daily smoke as it is not a cigar that proves more enjoyable by setting time aside to pay close attention.  With that said, I can see where a newer or infrequent smoker would find this pleasant.  It is not full bodied so there is no threat of having it sneak up to surprise you.  Its mild flavor would also prove unoffending to a less experienced participant.  Personally, I enjoy more flavorful and bold smokes but at about $2 per cigar it is one that would prove beneficial to keep around for mowing the lawn or donating to someone who would not necessarily appreciate a flavor bomb of a smoke.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

Feel free to follow him on Twitter!My name is Austin Fruechting, and I have been a cigar enthusiast for the past few years.  I began smoking a pipe seven years ago and dabbled in cigars.  After a couple years, cigars became my dominant preference.  I believe there is nothing better than to socialize around, or relax with, a cigar, especially if paired with a good scotch or wine.  Some of my favorite cigars include most of the Tatuaje line, Padron 64\u2019s & 26\u2019s, and Oliva V\u2019s & Cains.  I am an entrepreneur and my passion for business and for cigars has lead to the opening of my own cigar and wine bar, The 7th Street Reserve, which is scheduled to be open in the summer of 2010.This is cigar is part of Rocky Patel\u2019s limited release series and was gifted to me by a great BOTL.This is an attractive cigar with very well designed bands that compliment the dark Pennsylvania maduro wrapper quite nicely.  It is fairly toothy and has just a couple veins.  Although it doesn\u2019t have any soft spots, it does seem to get progressively tighter from the foot to the head.The wrapper and foot give off a very pleasant sweet tobacco scent with hints of cocoa.   The cold draw is fairly tight, but not too tight as to raise any concerns for the smoke.  The cold draw gives a very tantalizing sweet spiciness that stays on the tongue and lips as well as bits of leather and woodIt starts off very strong, definitely stronger and fuller bodied than Rocky Patel\u2019s average cigars.  The taste is a very complex spice, but not harsh. The best way I can describe the complexity is in a comparison to peppernuts.  There are just so many different spice flavors coming across that you just can\u2019t pick out one or two.  The smoke carries some cocoa aromas.  About one half inch in the cigar begins to mellow out some and some woody notes come in briefly and then fades out.  Shortly after that the cocoa that has been evident in the scent emerges in the taste.  The burn line in the first half is wavy, but not too bad.  It burns with a blue smoke and produces a fair amount of light grey smoke.  The ash is just plain ugly, but holds well.Halfway through the cigar the woody notes come back in with hints of leather.  This combines to create the dominant flavor of coffee at this point.  The cigar sticks with these flavors for a while, but transitions once more before the finish.  The cigar finishes with a harsher spiciness, black pepper, and a hint of chocolate.   The taste makes me think of burnt coffee that\u2019s been sitting on the warmer for days.  The burn line in the second half was not good.  It required a couple touchups.  Once it varied more than a half inch without showing any signs of correcting itself before I touched it up.I very much enjoyed this cigar and it was definitely one of my favorites from Rocky Patel.  The total smoke time on this cigar was 2 hours and 10 minutes.  It is a very full bodied cigar with a decent amount of complexity.  Its draw was a little too stiff, but I don\u2019t want to knock the cigar for this because the first one I had did not have this issue.  So as I have only had two, I don\u2019t know if this one was an anomaly or if others have that issue as well.  The finish was disappointing.  This cigar was on pace to be a great cigar, but the burn issues and the burnt coffee taste at the end diminished the overall experience quite a bit.If I found them in a store, I would definitely pick a few, especially since they\u2019re only $6-7 and of limited quantities, but wouldn\u2019t do a box.Austin \u2013Great review!

I am glad that I did.  This cigar's wrapper is grown in the Jamastran Valley of Honduras and the blend contains tobacco from 4 different countries.Appearance :  This Hoyo had a dark, oily, marble looking wrapper.  It had a Cuban style box press, but an ugly looking cap.  It had a strong tobacco prelight smell.  The label looked very similar to the one on the Cuban Hoyo Double Corona.Construction :  This cigar burnt evenly and had a perfect draw, but would not stay lit.  This cigar was not over humidified and I didn't leave it idle for long periods of time.  Nevertheless, it needed relight countless times... very annoying.Flavor :  The Hoyo de Tradicion opened peppery with subtle notes of sweetness.  It also had an underlying earthiness similar to a Thousand Series Padron.  It stayed consitent through the midpoint, then saw its sweetness dissipate through the 2nd half.  This left a straight pepper and earth core at the end.  The smoke had a smooth texture and was medium in strength.  A very pleasant smoke from beginning to end.Value :  MSRP on this cigar is around $5-$6, which I think is very reasonable considering this corona's above average flavor.Overall Rating :  I found this cigar to be a nice surprise considering the price.  It had above average complexity and had a good mix of flavors.  I hope the construction problems with regard to staying lit are the exception, rather than the norm.  I probably wouldn't buy a whole box of these, but would definitely keep 5-10 on hand.This post was written by Jason.

Disclaimer: La Palina is an advertiser on CigarInspector.com.I remember when I first heard about La Palina, I was not sure what to expect. An old cigar brand from the beginning of 20th century, revived and re-launched by a heir of broadcasting tycoons? This could be a big success just as well as a failure.La Palina was manufactured from 1896 to 1926 by Congress Cigar Company, founded by Samuel Paley, an immigrant from the Ukraine who had had a brilliant career in the cigar industry, starting as a lector and quickly becoming roller and then blender. Thanks to his passion, the company was successful and Samuel\u2019s son, William, continued the business and diversified it by investing in the radio as he saw its huge potential. This is how Columbia Broadcasting System, also known as \u201cThe Tiffany Network\u201d, was born. At the same time, Congress Cigar Company was liquidated.Bill Paley, Samuel\u2019s grandson, entrepreneur and philanthropist, set a quest to create a cigar emblematic of the original La Palina. He teamed up with Avelino Lara, a Cuban master blender responsible for the original Cohiba blends who was working at Graycliff at that time. Avelino Lara passed away in October 2009, but his inspiration lives on, guiding his son Abel and his loyal Cuban torcedores.This review concerns La Palina Alison, named after Bill\u2019s beautiful wife Alison Van Metre Paley.Appearance :  Wrapped in an Ecuadorian leaf, this 6 x 52 torpedo catches attention. The band, picturing Samuel\u2019s wife Goldey, is a beauty to look at, large but not disproportionate.

The draw is just spot on and so is the ash, holding strong for at least two inches. As for the burn, it did require a few corrections, thus 4 stars.Flavor :  The aged ligero filler is a blend of Honduran and Nicaraguan tobacco. My expectations for this cigar, crafted at the Graycliff factory, were set pretty high and at first I was slightly surprised, first pulls not bringing much flavor apart from subtle natural tobacco notes. Fortunately, this didn\u2019t last long and very soon I was enjoying a very spicy first third, bursting then smoothing out. The cigar becomes more and more complex and, well into the second third, black pepper \u2013 the main flavor so far \u2013 apart, there are notes of gingerbread, nuts and butter. The smoke is medium-bodied from the beginning and the strength is building up.

It's got some shiny areas with dull spots and vice versa.  A simple single cap that's neat enough and a soft box-press.\u201d -Brian (B-daddy)\u201cThe ugly appearance is somewhat redeemed by the aroma, it smells very pleasant. I'm picking up mild plain tobacco, and a little sweetness.\u201d -Emmett (rhetorik)\u201cThe cigar felt even in the hand.  It had a well done box press that was not too aggressive.  It was firm with no detectable soft spots.  They skimped on the cap and went with a single cap, no big deal though.\u201d -Will (Dubv23)Strength: Medium Body/Complexity: Medium\u201cUpon first puff i was greeted with light spice with a meaty/leathery flavor with a hint sweetness.\u201d -Nicholas (volpow61)\u201cRight away I get a nice little pepper blast that lingers on the tongue. Besides that, about the only thing I'm picking up is coffee. As this third progresses, it mellows out a little and opens up with some more flavor including more fresh tobacco. This stick isn't very complex so far, but what it does offer is good.\u201d -Emmett (rhetorik)Strength: Medium Body/Complexity: Medium\u201cFlavors began blending together, and intensifying. Some sweetness comes and goes. Enjoyed this third as well.\u201d -Robert (NavyPiper)\u201cI get a transition as the second third starts.  I'm getting a bit more spice and some leather flavors mixing with the cocoa.  The spice and leather linger on the finish.  Towards the end, I start to get some bitterness but it's not like a charcoal bitterness, it's more like a floral/hoppy ale.  It's nice and mild.  Unusual.\u201d -Brian (B-daddy)Strength: Medium-Strong Body/Complexity: Medium-Full\u201cIn the last third of the smoke spice and body pick up. also followed by some sweetness and meatiness it definitely ends with a bang.\u201d -Nicholas (volpow61)\u201cThe flavors in this third were the same as the previous third, but continued to increase in strength. About half way into this third, smoke increased greatly, and began to get a 'burnt' taste, but was not unpleasant. Smoked it to the nub. Really enjoyed it.\u201d -Robert (NavyPiper)\u201cDraw was decent.  It had some resistance, maybe just a tad more than I would prefer which could have caused the bitterness in this smaller ring gauge smoke.\u201d -Will (Dubv23)\u201cNear perfect.  Even. Ash holds for 2+ inches and the burn and draw combine to generate huge volumes of rich smoke from foot to head.  Not even close to needing a touch-up.\u201d -Brian (B-daddy)\u201cOverall a nice everyday smoke with some decent body and complexity.especially toward the end and depending on the price point, I could pick some more up.\u201d -Nicholas (volpow61)\u201cBecause of the burn and draw, this cigar was a joy to smoke.  Combined with very enjoyable flavors, I really liked this cigar.  It's not overly complex and the flavors aren't huge but the overall experience was very nice.\u201d -Brian (B-daddy)\u201cIf the price is right, I would call this a good budget choice. Nothing too complex or surprising, but a solid performance with some good flavors.\u201d -Emmett (rhetorik)\u201cVery nice stick, enjoyed all of it, and was quite flavorful. I'd buy some!\u201d -Robert (NavyPiper)\u201cThis was a good cigar.  It had some nice flavors that could be enjoyed anytime of the day by any smoker.  There was not any sort of nicotine buzz that I noticed.  It delivered the same flavors throughout the entire stick and did bring forth some bitterness at the halfway point.  This was not a complex cigar by any means.

I chose to try them in the order that they were released since the inception of the company and the brand. I started out with the mild and delicious Panacea Black Connecticut, followed that up with its brother the Panacea Black Maduro, and then smoked the large and robust Panacea Red 560. So now I come to the last cigar in the sampler. The Panacea Green is the blend I have been looking most forward to. It is the newest edition to the Panacea brand. According to their website they worked on this blend for over a year before it finally debuted in February of this year.The Panacea Green is a three ligero blend covered in a mottled brown Pennsylvania Broadleaf wrapper that has a nice oily sheen.  The band is a bright leprechaun green.  To be honest, it is not the prettiest of bands which detracts a bit from the aesthetics of the good looking wrapper leaf.  The cigar was firm and well filled and a test of the draw before lighting revealed a nice even pull.  From the very first puff on this cigar I was impressed and intrigued.  It has a wonderful spice to it that is very well balanced with notes of toasted tobacco and leather and a robust earthy finish.  he construction was impeccable.  The burn was nice and even and the ash seemed to hold on forever.  I only tapped the ash on this smoke 3 maybe four times and only for my comfort.  It seemed like it would have held longer than I was leaving it.   The flavors seemed to build in intensity as I progressed through the smoke.  There were notes of wood, leather, caramel, and tobacco.  In addition there was always that fantastic, unique spice that captivated me at the very start.  I cannot say for sure, but I am attributing it to the wrapper.  I wish I could be a better job at describing it.  Whatever that spice was and however it might be described, I really enjoyed it and the cigar as a whole.  I found it to be an excellent cigar, and one that I certainly want to smoke again.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

I believe that this brand is as close as you can get to a Cuban without actually smoking one.", "This is one of the best cigars out there. My favorite is the Padron 64 Exclusivo but this is a little more affordable (!), extremely enjoyable and very dependable with a great burn, easy draw and flawless construction. A very consistent, high quality smoke. I usually find them in my cigar shop in the robusto but I would love to get a toro size if they\u2019re available", "I\u2019ve heard great things about Tatuaje. I hope to get some soon!", "Had my first one today.  Wonderful stick.  good value also.  Met Pete Johnson at a local smoker\u2026.great guy, down to earth and knows his cigars.", "Congrats lil Tat!", "Just FYI it was the 2006 version that had the aged ligero corojo wrapper.  This 2009 version uses a sun grown broadleaf wrapper."], "construction": " The draw and burn of this cigar were perfect, but the ash fell off any time an appreciable amount collected.

The first Noella Reserva was released in 2006 . . . this is the 2009 version. I have yet to enjoy the original release, but if it\u2019s anything like this little firecracker, it will be quite the treat!As I understand the blend, it is the same as the standard Noella. However, the wrapper is a specially selected ligero that has been aged longer than the regular version. I have seen mixed numbers concerning the production of this release, but it appears that somewhere around 5,000 were produced.Appearance :  The wrapper is a very dark, almost black in appearance, and is very toothy, with a couple of prominent veins. The overall appearance is rather rough looking, but this is consistent with a Tatuaje-made cigar.Construction :  The draw and burn of this cigar were perfect, but the ash fell off any time an appreciable amount collected.  This didn\u2019t detract from the smoke, but it was a little annoying.Flavor :  Rich! That\u2019s how I would describe the flavor of this cigar. The initial pulls leave a creamy, peppery spice for your palate to enjoy. Quite quickly, the stick takes on a satisfying earthy taste with a vanilla undertone.  About halfway, there were full, dark chocolate flavors accompanied by a slight spice.  The flavor of this cigar reminded me of a cross between the rich earthiness of a Partagas and the cocoa/chocolate undertones of a fine Padron. Outstanding!Value :  At $8 a stick, this is a good buy.
