Not much can stop me when I\u2019m about to visit my local cigar shop, so quickly enough I purchased a fiver of Fonseca Delicias, which are 4.8 x 40 petit coronas.

The first puffs do not really make me want to pursue the experience \u2013 the smoke is rare, bland, with sugary and syrupy notes. Needless to say, the cigar is very mild at this point. Overall, I\u2019d give the first third a 1 out of 5. Fortunately, things get really better later on. First, some wood is added to the bouquet. Next (at the half-mark approximately), I am detecting pleasant espresso notes while the sweetness decreases. At the same time, the smoke becomes thicker and the cigar is almost medium-bodied.

Lightly veined and puckered, sweet smell.  The cap is very well constructed with a pig-tail twist.  I used the No2 hole of my Swiss Army Knife cigar punch and the draw is generous and may benefit from the smaller punch.First third:  Easy to roast foot and draw from roast.  Instant rich cloud, fairly tangy but not bitter.The background bouquet is less obvious than the Reyes, but the flavour is fuller.  Very chocolaty.  Beautifully even burn & nice stack.  At 44, the ring may be a bit of a mouthful for the beginner.Second third:  Pleasant nuttiness developing; having this with an American strength coffee which is being a bit overwhelmed, obviously quite robust and requires fuller flavours of drink & food.  That said, the retro-inhale is mild and needs to be rolled around a lot, leaving a long after taste of fine Cuban.  The stack remains very robust, holds well, minimal mess!Final third:  A very enjoyable part.  The bouquet\u2019s intensity increases though it is still comparatively mild without being insipid, making this a pleasant ambience.  This cigar may safely be put down between draws without going out, demonstrating the excellent build quality.One note of caution, it is imperative this have been well kept; at this length, any dryness will result in the wrapper peeling towards the end. I strongly urge buyers to ensure that, unless kept in a purpose made humidor, they ask the shop to put the stick in a cardboard sleeve and then into a small sealable plastic bag with a gentle spray of water. This will keep any cigar usable for a day or so. Additionally, most bigger dealers have purpose made sealable foil bags by EMS which are ideal.In sum:  An excellent medium size cigar for the beginner as well as the seasoned aficionado.

Recently I had some friends who went on vacation in Cuba. I asked them if they would mind purchasing me some cigars and, being such nice people, they of course were happy to oblige. So I proceeded to write them a list of what I would like. I always make a large list for anyone going to Cuba as it is difficult to judge what each LCDH will be stocking at the time. First on my list was the Partagas Serie P No. 2 - one of, if not my favourite cigar currently on the market. When they arrived home they gave me a call and assured me that they had purchased my greatly desired Partagas P 2\u2019s. When the box arrived at my house I found out that they actually bought Partagas Mille Fleurs. Now while I had not yet tried the Mille Fleurs, and I had always read good things about them, you cannot blame me too much for being disappointed that I wasn\u2019t actually getting P2\u2019s. Despite all this, I have now smoked a few of the Mille Fleurs and have tried to write as unbiased a review as I could. And I must admit after trying a few of the Mille Fleurs I am impressed.Appearance :  The Mille Fleurs have a pretty rough appearance. The quality of wrapper is inconsistent and many have large, heavy veins resembling scars. The time that they have spent in the box has given most of them a nice box press which is something that impresses me. The wrapper is medium brown in colour and a few of the wrappers have small tears in them. Some of the Mille Fleurs have sun spots and discolouration in the wrapper.

I am disappointed because the seams show some lack of attention and the wrappers pulled off of a couple of the cigars I sampled. The burn line of each one is a touch uneven yet remains constant throughout the entire smoke so I did not have to correct the burn during any of them. The draw was slightly firm and consistent between each one. There was a nice firm ash and a nice cool burn that was neither too fast nor too slow.Flavor :  The cold draw revealed an earthy flavour. I lit up and the Mille Fleurs began with creamy, round smoke, some cappuccino flavour and a leathery finish. This was pleasant but fairly one-dimensional. Halfway through the smoke becomes spicy with some black pepper on the palate. With about an inch and half left the pepper and leather elements blended to create a rich medium-bodied cigar.Usually when I smoke a cigar I try to note a point where it is at its best \u2013 a sweet spot. I assumed this was it and that I would not see very much change from then on. Much to my surprise, this is where the cigar really took off. Flavours of dark chocolate and black coffee enter on the palate giving the Mille Fleurs a new dimension. On the finish I occasionally get a very light aroma of musk. The leather that has made periodic appearances increases in strength with some essence of hazelnuts and charred beach wood. The leather finish transforms and what was once fresh new leather evolves to aged, well-worn leather. The smoke has remained surprisingly cool the whole time. I had the Mille Fleurs down to the smallest nub when it starts to burn my lips, so I grabbed a glass of water to cool down which allowed me to have a few more puffs.Value :  I don\u2019t have too much to say about the value of these. It\u2019s pretty obvious that in Cuba these are a great buy and I will definitely be putting them higher up on my list of cigars to get from there. Here in Canada around 9 dollars is, in my opinion, fair and for that price I would put this into my rotation of cigars in the ten dollar price range.

I myself have smoked a few since I got them and every time I finish one, I am both content with the cigar and yet I want to light up another to start the experience all over again.One of my favourite qualities is the versatility when it comes to pairing with drinks. I smoked the first one with a bottle of Louis Latour Pinot Noir (2007) which was my favourite pairing. These would also go great with a nice ruby port or a good stout. I tried one with a glass of Crown Royal Black which I did not like as much. My final comment is that the Mille Fleurs are a must share cigar. The flavours and fragrances are enhanced by the sound of conversation and the presence of friends.  With the warm weather approaching and the restaurant balconies opening; I would suggest taking a Friday afternoon off to meet up with some friends at your favourite bistro, order a bottle (or 2) of your favourite wine, pass around some Mille Fleurs and enjoy.This post was written by Tyler.

I really like the H. Upmann line and I always enjoy an aged H. Upmann.  I had one remaining single HUSC from a fiver as well as an unbroken box (same box code).

Overall, a little mild to begin and I have to fight the urge to double-puff for a stronger experience. About an inch in it becomes difficult to identify the components of flavor as they blend so well together.  The absence of spice and pepper is notable.I paired it with a very dry gin martini which is almost too strong for the cigar (though it paired perfectly with a H. Upmann Royal Robusto last night), but it does emphasize the earth, wood and leather tastes.  A scotch or bourbon would overwhelm this cigar.  I\u2019ve given in to the need to double-puff and am rewarded for it with an appropriate level of flavor.  The tea and lead tastes have diminished and it tastes remarkably similar to an aged H. Upmann Monarch or Lonsdale.Halfway through, the flavor has built a bit but remains basically unchanged.  The flavor continues to build into the last third, becoming a bit harsh.

The ash held on for an amazingly long time without disrupting the draw or burn at all.  Construction is close to perfect.Flavor :  (3.75) I expected hay given the pre-light aroma, but I got cedar when I first lit up.  There is a bit of spice thrown in for good measure, and the flavors take on a creamier characteristic as the stogie approaches the middle third.  At this point, the honey I smelled on pre-light emerges, and only then does the hay really come to the foreground.  The peppery spiciness builds up toward the final third, and the cream melts into the backdrop.  The cocoa note also plays in the backdrop throughout the smoke.

Overall, nothing to get too excited about but the cigar is far from boring.Value :  Given that these are roughly $6 each, they are quite reasonable.  While I often enjoy a cigar which I can smoke for a good long time, sometimes you need something that isn\u2019t going to fill such a large space of time.  And for that, these Half Coronas are perfect.Overall Rating :  (4.25) There is nothing not to like about the H. Upmann Half Corona.  These cigars are small, affordable, and ideal for days when you are pressed for time and want to relax\u2014but cannot afford an hour and a half to enjoy a stogie.  The flavors and aromas are pretty good and the construction is great.  I can definitely see why these have become a regular favorite for so many smokers.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

At this point, the honey I smelled on pre-light emerges, and only then does the hay really come to the foreground.  The peppery spiciness builds up toward the final third, and the cream melts into the backdrop.  The cocoa note also plays in the backdrop throughout the smoke.

Check out his shop for a nice selection of Cuban and non-Cuban cigars.Another addition to our collection of Cuban cigars that you can't really find reviewed online (unless you're a better Googler than me, of course), Juan Lopez Short Torpedo was released in 2008 for the Caribbean market and, so far, this is the only regional edition for that zone. A 5 x 50 short torpedo, this is definitely not the first cigar of this size that was recently released; it's a whole trend (ErdM Petit Compania, Bolivar Petit Belicoso among others) and, to be honest, I am not against it since I rather like this size.

Created in 1848, it has been sold and re-sold at least five times to finally end up between the hands of El Rey del Mundo house in 1931. A couple of decades after that, the flagship vitolas like Belicosos and Molinos were among the most popular in Europe.

The bigger ring guage compared to the famosos is good because I prefer 50 or more ring guage cigars and I really only found minor differences in flavour when compared to the famosos.  These petit robainas are uniquely their own in flavour but if tasting blind, I don\u2019t think I would find major differences in the profiles of the two sticks.

Enjoy!The Vegas Robaina Petit Robaina is a regional edition for Canada released in 2009. I have become more fascinated with regionals as of late. This particular cigar with its stubby size and stout ring gauge appealed to me when I first saw it.

The burn was quite sharp, especially considering I fumbled the lighting process with this one. However, it quickly corrected itself. The draw was spot on, with clouds of smoke from each puff.Flavor :  The pre-draw was woody and sweet. Upon lighting, that woody sweetness continues with some earthiness and cocoa added to the mix. Very pleasant. This cigar provided rich subtle flavors that were not overpowering in the least. The second third provided the same rich flavors with an additional hint of spice, not much spice, just a touch. I noticed an occasional hint of cinnamon in the mix. This did not last long however. The final third provided an increased spice, but pretty much stayed consistent with the same flavors until the end.

Cohiba is considered as the best cigar brand in the world by most people and although I always found their cigars above average, just a little something was missing. Well, I guess I found it in this Cohiba Seleccion Piramide. This is a truly magnificent cigar.Appearance :  If not for a tiny glitch at the foot of the cigar (see first photograph), I would give it a 5 out of 5 without a second thought. The wrapper is dark (slightly brighter than Maduro 5), smooth and oily. Unlit, it smells like a good cigar should smell - a mix of strong, superior tobacco, and humus - a very intense smell that is almost unpleasant yet it makes you want to smell it again and again.Construction :  The cigar is superbly constructed, once lit I could easily forget about watching the burn. I also had a perfect draw throughout the smoke.Flavor :  The beginning brings soft notes of precious wood mixed with some pleasant spiciness. At that moment I could already feel that I was holding a very complex cigar. A few minutes in, I thought that I distinguished a hint of cocoa. I was not sure about that until I reached the second third, where dark chocolate was really present. One flavor complementing another, the second third was extremely complex and delicious. In the beginning of the last third, the exciting flavors of spice and chocolate were progressively replaced by earthy and leathery notes, rather soothing. I will just say that, flavor-wise, the Cohiba Seleccion Piramide is as good as it can get.Value :  I think that this one has a better price/quality ratio than some other high-priced Cohibas, such as Cohiba Esplendidos or Siglo VI. This is definitely a must-try.Overall Rating :  I am sorry if I said too many good words about this cigar, but I couldn't help. It really impressed me and, along with the Opus X that I reviewed recently, will probably be my favorite high-priced cigar.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

The name comes from the 520th year anniversary of the discovery of tobacco in Cuba. The wrapper, filler and binder have been aged for a period of at least 2 years. My sample had a June 2012 production date box code. The Ediciones Limitadas are made with the finest tobacco leaves coming from Vuelta Abajo region, considered to be the best tobacco growing region in Cuba.Appearance :  (4.75) The Monte 520 is a big, heavy cigar wrapped in a dark brown leaf that almost resembles a Colorado Maduro.

However, as with all Habanos, a little time in the humidor, if you have the patience, will do it wonders.The Montecristo 520 is heavy and packed with tobacco.  As you can see in the image of the foot, they certainly used a lot of tobacco for this cigar but this is not always a good thing.  I found the draw somewhat tight and at times struggled to get good smoke output but to be frank, for the most part the smoke output was good. The burn was very impressive. Due to the tight draw I did find myself needing to re-light it again just beyond the half-way mark.I\u2019ve read reviews indicating the draw was very loose considering the amount of tobacco but I found exactly the opposite.  The draw on mine was very tight.  The ash was firm, not flakey and held on for a good 2 inches before falling off.Flavor :  The pre-light aroma had nice hints of cocoa, coffee and sweet cedar.  The pre-light draw, while tight, revealed some hints of sweet wood, cocoa, leather and a hint of pepper.The first third of the cigar was really tough to draw on.  As a result, some of the flavors were a tad muted from the get go and the smoke output was not very rich.  It took a couple of centimetres to get some of the young cigar flavors out of the way but once they did, the cigar started to taste really nice; not spectacular but enjoyable.  The smoke itself wasn\u2019t a velvety creamy smoke but a drier smoke with not much residue on the palate. The cigar had some nice cocoa, leather and chocolate flavors with sweet oak and earthy undertones and spice on the finish.By the time I reached the second third, the cigar opened up a bit more and started to come into its own. The draw loosened up a bit and the flavors became more intense.  I got some woodsy and grassy notes with cocoa and coffee flavors becoming a little richer.  The earthiness of the cigar was prominent but it did have some pleasant and rich cocoa and coffee flavors to help balance it out. The pepper on the finish remained and the finish was still medium with pepper lingering at the back of the palate. This unfortunately did not last long.The second third of the cigar unfortunately started to weaken in flavor until around the halfway point where I got some honey line sweetness and some slight citrus/tea flavor.  I expected to get more flavour from this behemoth of a cigar but as the cigar went on, I just got more of the same apart from this burst around the halfway mark.  I got very little in the way of flavor transition, complexity or richness.  The smoke remained dry and the flavors remained pretty much the same.  Coffee, cocoa, leather and hints of sweet wood were the primary flavors.  There was a hint of salt on the lips but not that salty \u201ctwang\u201d that we normally get from Cuban cigars.  The peppery finish remained though.The final third offered more of the same. Primarily sweet wood, earthy and grassy flavors with the occasional bursts of cocoa and semi-sweet coffee. A little bitterness that I likened to dark unsweetened chocolate entered the profile in the final third and while it wasn\u2019t constant, there were enough bitter puffs for me to take note.   The draw remained quite tight and smoking this giant was really starting to become a struggle. Having to take double puffs to get a good mouthful of smoke is not what I prefer. This causes the cigar to burn hotter and can really impact the flavors. I tried to keep it slow but by doing so, I needed to re-light the cigar after the halfway point.Value :  It sells in Cuba for approximately 14 Cuban Pesos.  I have found it at some duty free Canadian retailers from approximately $28.50 (which is where mine were purchased from). However, I called up 3 local cigar shops in my area and found that they pretty much retailed at between $45.99 to $49.99 (Canada is heavily taxed on tobacco products).

It lacked complexity and the connoisseur will definitely know they are smoking a Montecristo.

Check out his shop for a nice selection of Cuban and non-Cuban cigars.This version of the San Cristobal Oficios (click here for the review of the regular one) comes from a limited edition humidor, released in 2004 to celebrate the fifth birthday of the brand. In fact, this was the first appearance of the Oficios vitola. Consequently, it is quite an aged cigar, with approximately 6 years of humidor time. Let\u2019s see how this 5.3 x 43 corona smokes!With its pale brown wrapper and several visible veins, this cigar looks very much like the Oficios I smoked half a year ago. Moderately firm to the touch, it has an easy pre-draw with surprising notes of peppermint. In the beginning, it is medium-bodied, dominated by wood / cedar flavors. The burn is simply excellent \u2013 slow and regular \u2013 resulting in a beautiful ash holding for over 2 inches. As I tap this first ash off, the flavors have slightly changed \u2013 a bit of leather is added to the bouquet and there is definitely some moderate spice in the back of the throat. Surprisingly, I have a sudden construction issue \u2013 first of all, the ash, not even 1 inch long, falls into my lap and then, when I\u2019m done cleaning my short, the cigar goes out. Cursing quietly, I relight it just to find a very flavorful last third (I purged the cigar after re-lighting it), characterized by thick smoke with deep, complex flavors that, besides those that were mentioned before, include sweet coffee with milk and sweet chocolate.Overall, a very interesting cigar, however, I am not sure that it is any better than the regular one. If you have a chance try it out - otherwise I wouldn't go out of my way to specifically hunt it.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Those Prensado Churchill cigars aren\u2019t cheap here in Canada after our taxes are included into the pricing and easily exceed $20.00 a cigar.  The point is that notwithstanding the price tag, the BHK 52 is worth every cent paid for it and truly offers an aficionado a glimpse into the world of what a cigar was meant to taste like.

The cigar received extensive reviews at the time of release ranging from over-priced to the best cigar the reviewer had ever tasted.  I understand that whenever a cigar is priced in the highest end of the price range for a particular product, there will often be resentment associated with that. However, the fact they are priced in the \u201cexclusive\u201d end is perhaps why they are consistently sold out even two years after their release.  Although we can still call this cigar new to the scene, it really isn\u2019t all that new to the aficionado anymore because anyone with a passion for Cuban cigars knows very well about the story behind these cigars and their desire among smokers and collectors alike.  One of the best cigars to come out of Cuba in a long time is also one of the most, if not THE most expensive to come off the Island and as a result,  people will have varying opinions, often wrongly, because of that price tag.What makes the Behike so special is that unlike many other Cubans, this cigar, for all intent and purpose really needs no aging in large part due to the fact that the cigar is essentially constructed with aged tobacco. For example, the filler is made up of tobacco known as medio tiempo which is a sun-grown leaf that grows at the top of tobacco plants.  Not all tobacco plants produce this leaf though but it is known to be full-bodied and loaded with coffee-like flavors with a very creamy texture to the smoke.  Essentially, this leaf has elements of tobacco leaf that has already been aged and, even with young medio tiempo, one can detect the same creamy, earthy and coffee-like flavors of a well-aged cigar.  The BHK comes in 52, 54 and 56 which corresponds to their respective ring gauges and, once stabilized for humidity, can be smoked \u201cout of the box\u201d.I\u2019ve been lucky enough to obtain 2 boxes both from Cuba and at Cuban pricing.  The first one, bearing a box date of October 2011, was brought back for me in early December of 2011 from a vacationing friend.  At 180 Cuban Pesos per cigar, the 10-count box worked out to 18.00 Cuban Pesos per stick. With an exchange rate to the Canadian dollar being almost equal, we can fairly say that these cigars were roughly $18.00 each. The second box was purchased for me in June of 2012 and they carried a box date of May 2012. Again, I placed the order through a vacationing friend and that second box cost me 183.00 Cuban Convertible Pesos or roughly $185.00 Canadian dollars for a 10 count box ($18.50 each cigar).These cigars sell out fast wherever they are, indicating that the price is not keeping people from indulging in the pleasure. I\u2019ll comment some more about this later.  First, however, let\u2019s talk about these cigars of which I have 1 box left, having smoked the last one out of my first box just a few weeks ago.Appearance :  This cigar is simply beautiful.

It is fair to say that I don\u2019t think anyone who smokes this cigar will be disappointed.  I can honestly say that for the first time in a long time, smoking the Behike BHK 52 actually stimulated all 5 of my senses at the same time combining everything into an excellent 70 minutes experience.  Even after smoking 10 of them, my experience never changes.The cigar starts with a very creamy, velvety smoke that leaves a very pleasant sheen on your palate that never disappears.  The smoke output from the moment you light it never changes, remaining consistently thick and creamy.The initial flavors are woodsy with some very pleasant earthiness and slight coffee flavors.  You can say that they are typical of the high quality Cohibas however there is an added dimension to these cigars on lighting them that can easily be detected.  Prerhaps it is the fact that they are so smokeable right out of the box.  There is just a hint of pepper on the finish and a perfectly balanced saltiness on the lips that helps marry the flavors.By the time the first third of the cigar is finished, you\u2019ve already gone through some very complex flavors that many cigars lack during their entire smoking time.  I picked up hints of vanilla, cocoa, earth, cedar and some slight citrus, all coming and going all the while having that pleasant saltiness on the lips that only a Cuban cigar can offer.  The spice was always there but neatly packed away at the back of the palate and never getting in the way of the enjoyment of the cigar.The second third of the cigar continues to give me something different with each draw.  The primary flavors remain chocolaty, woodsy and coffee but there are always hints of flavour coming into the profile.  At this point I start to pick up hints of citrus, vanilla and the occasional sweetness similar to that of a thick cocoa or a perfectly brewed espresso with the right amount of crema on top. So many flavors but yet so perfectly balanced.I start to detect some leather notes as I approach the halfway point of the cigar with some very creamy smoke.  I liken the smoke to the foam of a perfectly made cappuccino. Thick, velvety and flavourful; I wouldn\u2019t say that it is caramel-like but more of a textured, creamy smoke. It is a very pleasant texture indeed.The cigar continues to provide very complex and extremely pleasing flavours right until the very end. Trying to break down each third is pointless for such a fine and deeply complex cigar because it is constantly evolving as you smoke it.This cigar takes you on a very pleasant journey.  What starts as a slightly woodsy cigar, reminiscent of the Cohiba brand as we know it, turns into a cigar that offers the occasional hint of orange peel, coffee, and semi-sweet chocolate. Some very sweet flavors that are occasionally mixed in with some spots where one can pick up some unsweetened coffee, dark chocolate, leather and cedar. The transition from sweetness to the occasional pleasant bitterness is seamless and very well blended.  The bitterness isn\u2019t a disturbing bitterness but more like the flavors one gets from a quality dark chocolate or unsweetened espresso, however the slight hints of vanilla and citrus magnificently balance it all.The spice is pure Cohiba.  You know it\u2019s there, it is clearly detectable in the finish but never gets in the way of the enjoyment of the cigar. There is just enough of it and exactly when the cigar needs it.  I have been smoking cigars for 20 years and I can honestly say that I have had maybe 5 brands that had such a complex flavour profile with a seemingly perfect blend and transition.As I said at the outset, this cigar truly utilizes all 5 of your senses.  First and most importantly, the taste is something that once you smoke one, you never forget. You are constantly challenging your palate trying to pick out that next enjoyable flavour note.  All the while you can hear that cigar burning with every draw as your eyes remain fixed on those thick white clouds of creamy smoke, that is, if you can take your eyes off the beautiful band that graces the cigar.  Finally, if tasting, listening, looking and smelling the experience isn\u2019t enough, you will be more than pleased with the perfect balance of this very well constructed cigar. You can feel its flawless construction and perfect balance in your hand while taking in all that this cigar has to offer.  It is truly an aficionado\u2019s experience and such a pleasure to see Cuba putting out a true standout. I can\u2019t find one negative about this cigar\u2019s flavour profile.Value :  This is perhaps the most debatable aspect of this review and any review for that matter. What is value after all?  Many will despise the cigar simply because of the price. There is no way that they will spend so much money on 1 cigar yet those same people will surely hunt out the best bottle of wine or spirit of their choice.  There is admittedly a trap when reviewing something so expensive.  It is easy to simply love the cigar because you are getting a chance to smoke something so exclusive and pricey in an attempt to justify the price tag.I find myself asking why some people spend extra money on the \u201cbetter\u201d bottle of wine, or on the XO cognac or the scotch with more age to it?  It\u2019s simple.  Because we want the best that our money can buy.  I don\u2019t begrudge anyone for buying Louis XIII Cognac if they can afford to, nor do I begrudge anyone for buying a bottle of Glenfiddich Royal Salute 21 year old scotch or a bottle of Johnny Walker Blue.  It\u2019s because those that do, like what they are spending their money on and don\u2019t mind paying that little bit extra to ensure that they enjoy their experience.Sure, this cigar does not fall into every smoker\u2019s budget but neither are any of the aforementioned spirits.  That doesn\u2019t necessarily make those products \u201cpoor value\u201d.  When assessing Value, I like to ask myself if what I just enjoyed was worth the money spent.  In that regard, and of course taking into consideration that my BHK 52\u2019s were purchased in Cuba, the answer is an un-resounding \u201cyes\u201d. Would I pay $40.00 for one?  Absolutely, but not in the same quantity but certainly for that moment when I truly want to sit down and know that I am about to experience something special.Now I understand that not every smoker will be able to get these cigars at Cuban prices but not every drinker of fine spirits can get their hands on duty free liquor either but they continue to spend money on what they perceive to be the best their money can buy and if the best your money can buy includes a BHK 52 then I don\u2019t have a problem with that.All in all, value is perceived as being worth the price of admission. A cigar can have tremendous value but taste horrible. A great tasting cigar might not be worth the money spent on it because there are better cigars available for the price. However, the Behike, price tag aside, is perhaps the best cigar I have smoked in the last 10 years or so and for that reason alone, it was worth every cent. As a smoker, I received excellent value for my cigar experience.When assessing value we must also consider the market that this cigar is manufactured for. Therefore as I noted, It was worth every cent because the experience I had from smoking it was exactly what I have been waiting for from a cigar for a very long time and is unique to anything else out there on the market.Overall Rating :  In conclusion, it\u2019s easy to say that I\u2019ve fallen into the trap of trying to justify such an expensive cigar however I can equally state that some critics of the cigar are basing their experience on the price tag too. Remember, I absolutely despised the Alec Bradley Prensado, despite the fact that it was named the cigar of the year and at the time seemed it was in style to simply like that cigar as a result without dissecting it.  Those Prensado Churchill cigars aren\u2019t cheap here in Canada after our taxes are included into the pricing and easily exceed $20.00 a cigar.  The point is that notwithstanding the price tag, the BHK 52 is worth every cent paid for it and truly offers an aficionado a glimpse into the world of what a cigar was meant to taste like.  Not unlike some of the higher end Padron Series of cigars, this cigar is meant to cater to the true aficionado that loves a quality cigar and is willing to pay for the experience.  It is really a very unique and rewarding experience.  It\u2019s like sipping a sniffer of Louis XIII de R\u00e9my Martin Cognac or enjoying a bottle of the best red wine on the wine list at your favorite fine dining establishment.  You do it because you want to enjoy your experience.I certainly wouldn\u2019t call this cigar an \u201cevery day\u201d smoke because of its price but then again, in the real world, Louis XIII de R\u00e9my Martin Cognac or the best red on the list aren\u2019t daily drinking spirits either.  However, this cigar, like those fine spirits, is there for those times when you want to relax and take yourself on a magnificent 70 minute journey of the senses.  The best part is, you know what you are going to get for your money because the consistency that accompanies this cigar\u2019s profile and construction s simply astounding.I hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this review.

The wrapper is a light tan color with some noticeable bloom and plume. And the construction is perfect. It\u2019s a pretty good looking cigar and I like the \u201cnon traditional\u201d label it comes with.Smelling the wrapper is amazing and it was one of the highlights of this cigar. There\u2019s a strong sweet tobacco aroma with a little cedar smell behind it. It was strong and in your face and I just sat there awhile smelling the wrapper because it was that good. It\u2019s not too often that you can just sit there and enjoy the aroma of only the wrapper.Lets talk about the flavors... There\u2019s something about this cigar that makes you stop and look at it. And that\u2019s the first puff. On the first puff I picked up absolutely no pepper and no spice (which is great) like I did on the pre-draw, but what I did pick up was smoothness. Now I know smoothness is not a flavor, but sometimes I feel like it is. When you can \u201cfeel\u201d the smoothness of the smoke on your palate it leaves a soft complex taste and I love that!After the wonderful hits of smoothness, the first initial flavors I picked up was a vegetable-like taste, with tons of rich earthy flavors. I was in heaven with this flavor profile because it\u2019s something I am not used to and this Cuban is nothing like the other Cubans I've smoked. I also picked up some flavors of nuts, roasted coffee and more earthy undertones. I'm not sure where I got that \u201cvegetable flavor\u201d from, but on the first few puffs that\u2019s what I tasted on my palate. It never came back, which sucks because I really enjoyed it. Besides, wouldn\u2019t you rather smoke veggies than eat them?The flavors don\u2019t change and remain consistent throughout the entire cigar. It picks ups in strength a little towards the end, but for the most part this cigar stays in the mild and medium strength level. It also remains smooth and so fresh on your palate and you got to love that!One small downfall I did have was the rollercoaster burn. At times it was great and at times it was bad, but with a little fixing it turns out fine. Sometimes when you stop to fix a cigar it can ruin your experience with it, but that wasn\u2019t the case here. If anything, it was worth the time to stop just so you can keep going. Especially when you\u2019re enjoying it so much.By the time I finished my cigar I was feeling good. I was impressed with the flavors and even more impressed to find no spice and no pepper. I would absolutely smoke this cigar again and of course I recommend for you try it out.Final Note: As good as this cigar was for me. I cannot crown this cigar as the best Cuban I have smoked.

For over 10 years they ship Cuban cigars from Hong Kong at competitive prices.I've been lucky enough to sample several regional editions recently, here is my first one from Pacific Asia. I decided to get smart and took the picture of the cigar with the Temple of Heaven in the background, then remembered that there were also special REs for China. How do they call it? \"Fail\"?Anyway, Bolivar Short Bolivar is a short edmundo, reminding me very much of the Petit Libertador, released the same year. I would probably be unable to tell these two apart if you removed the second bands. Even though the sizes vary slightly, I expected to find a similar flavor profile... and I was not far off. For some reason, I liked the Short Bolivar better though.Appearance :  The overall presentation is encouraging despite several wrapper imperfections. The triple cap is accurately applied and easily comes off when prompted. Well-rolled, it seems to be slightly softer near the foot. I spend more time than I usually do smelling the cigar as it exhales an amazing flavor of sweet, strong tobacco.Construction :  Only one complaint for this otherwise beautifully constructed cigar - uneven burn. A couple of times I had to use the lighter to correct the burning line - do not wait until it gets out of control. This little powerhouse produced incredible quantities of smoke and drawed fine.Flavor :  I begin by toasting the foot of this Short Bolivar, then it's time for the first pull. Powerful, it brings a good dose of fresh nicotine that makes my tongue and nostrils tingle. There's black pepper in the bouquet. A lot of black pepper, actually. As the flavor settles down, I find the usual Bolivar notes - toasted bread, roasted coffee, wood. The smoke is thick and buttery, pleasantly coating the palate despite an obvious power. In the second third, toasted & roasted notes continue to dominate, there is also less pepper and more wood in the bouquet. Medium- to full-bodied, the cigar provides a long finish and leaves a feeling of satisfaction.Value :  At $12 each by box, that's not a cheap cigar even by Cuban standards.Overall Rating :  So, what can we say about the Short Bolivar? Is it a good cigar? Sure, especially if you enjoy the brand's flavor profile. Is it worth the money? Probably, if you factor in the rarity, the price of the second band and the (considerable) ageing potential. If you are a collector, enjoy Bolivars and this particular format, then it's a safe box purchase. Otherwise, there are ways to better spend your money.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Obviously hand rolled with pleasant unevenness, leaf veins pronounced but not intrusive. Firm cap, easy to cut with sharp knife, no compression. Lighted:  Somewhat uneven burn. Flecked, bitty ash. First \u2153: mild with a bit of after bite. Sweet on the underside of the tongue. Extremely cool draw.  Cocoa flavour developing, becoming milder?  Robust ash, though still uneven with \u00bc\u201d discrepancy. Second \u2153:  Juicy, but mild, comparable to El Rey Demi-tasse. Draw becoming firmer. Unevenness becoming quite pronounced with elements of non-burn, untidy. Cocoa has given way to nutty. Quite possibly head cut not deep enough, buildup of moisture compacting cap.  Extremely cool draw but noticeable bite on lips.  Draw becoming a bit laborious, will cut a bit deeper into end cap. Final \u2153: Success! Another 1/2mm off cap, lots of moisture but instant freeing up of draw.  Unevenness relentless, following line of leaf roll. Developing espresso edge.  Flameout! Relight, almost crater at foot, harsh couple of draws. Quickly re established burn but along diagonal of wrapper leaf line. Flameout, again!  Better relight, surprisingly mild and relatively cool to the final nub, though with espresso strong roast aftertaste. Final bit for sheer bloody mindedness sake!  Hot to draw. In sum: A very satisfying, gentle flavour, a bit of hard work, not ideal for a beginner. Remember to cut at least \u00bc\u201d off cap! Suitable step up from an El Rey demitasse. Not very suitable for breezy out of doors!

Hand-Made Price : $11.00 each/ $55.00 for 5 cigar cardboard pack Canada (LCDH)More info about purchasing Rafael Gonzalez cigars...Today we are bringing you a guest cigar review by Sean. Rafael Gonzalez Perlas is a good value Cuban cigar that shouldn't be overlooked.Pre-light :  Dark Maduro wrapper that has a slightly dusty bloom. It looks very welcoming. Decent construction, although the cap is not executed perfectly as you get with other cigars this size like Cohiba Siglo I, or Montecristo No. 5. There are small veins that are not at all dominant, and overall the cigar feels quite heavy for its small size and is well packed with uniform feel. The smell is that of mild barnyard that has a hint of sweetness, reminiscent of dark chocolate. The cold draw tasted somewhat sweet with hints of roasted nuts and typical Cuban tobacco. The band is the non-glossy, non-embossed band, which I still haven\u2019t figured out, as other vitolas are donning a darker more glossy embossed band. According to the information obtained online, the non-glossy band was discontinued in 2010, so I suspect that these cigars are 2 years aged prior to their 2012 release, explaining the band.Flavor : 1st Third: This cigar is wonderful from the first draw. Mild to medium Cuban tobacco flavor that is fairly complex for a small, cheaper cigar. The dominant flavor I taste is coffee that has a slightly sweet chocolate aftertaste. Lots of creamy smoke, and razor sharp burn and a good firm draw.2nd Third: Same flavor profile but more intense. As this small cigar reaches the halfway point, it approaches medium tobacco flavor, but the coffee I picked up from the beginning is now more intense, more of an espresso or dark roast, and earth flavors. Also I can still detect a sweet note to finish. Ash remained intact until almost through the second third, and was medium to dark grey.Final 3rd:  Intensity has increased, and now the dominant flavor is that of spice with leathery notes, and hints of roasted coffee. I\u2019m happy that the cigar is not too hot, because I intend to smoke this one to the nub. Creamy medium smoke continues to coat my mouth, with an even burn right to the nub. I\u2019m sad to see this one end and look forward to smoking this cigar again.Overall Rating :  This cigar is great for any level of smoker, from an aficionado to first time smoker. Well-constructed, although not to the extent of premium Cuban cigars such as Montecristo No. 5 or Cohiba Siglo I. But for half the price, this one holds against those very well with a complex flavor profile, razor sharp burn, and a very clean, delicious creamy smoke. The aftertaste coats the palate and is very pleasing, with taste of dark chocolate and roasted coffee that is still with me hours later.I make sure that I always keep at least a couple of these in my humidor, for times when I don\u2019t have an hour plus to enjoy a cigar. The smoke time on this was 42 minutes, great for when I\u2019m at work, being that I work onboard a ship time isn\u2019t always that available and I have to smoke outside. This cigar would go great with a coffee. I accompanied it with a glass of water because I enjoy the flavor of these so much that I didn\u2019t want it to be eclipsed by anything else.The Rafael Gonzalez Perla is a top Cuban value cigar, and although I paid quite a high price for it from a LCDH, it is worth every penny. This is a bargain Cuban with a premium flavor, which is on par or better than any other brand making the Perla vitola.", "flavor": "", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/rafael-gonzalez-perlas-450x2981.jpg?iv=16"}, "hoyo de monterrey le hoyo des dieux": {"origin": "Origin : Cuba Format : Corona Grande Size : 155 x 16.67 mm Ring : 42 Weight : 10.14 g Hand-Made Price : ~$420 for a cabinet of 50More info about purchasing Hoyo de Monterrey cigars...", "overall rating": " It's good to smoke in the morning, when you're not ready for something strong.

It is definitely a change of pace from the mundane, a new flavor to my collection.  I was pleasantly surprised that the usual maduro taste was not the overwhelming characteristic of this smoke.  I would not put it in the Siglo VI category just yet.

It is a 5.5 x 54 grand robusto, slightly shorter than Montecristo Sublimes that I recently reviewed. This is not the first limited edition from the brand, far from that - Romeo y Julieta have released 7 LEs (more than any other brand), including this one. I cannot say anything about the older releases, but the most recent Escudo seems to be a decent smoke. I smoked two cigars for this review and they were pretty consistent in terms of flavor and construction.Appearance :  The looks are there. Duke sports an extremely attractive shiny brown wrapper with several water spots and moderate veining. The sour intense smell has become a standard for any high quality Cuban. The cigar is well-packed without any soft spots. I easily removed the bands, cut the cigar and discovered a very easy, round pre-draw with notes of cedar.Construction :  Although in terms of draw there is nothing to complain about, I was not totally satisfied by the burn on this stick - I needed to correct it several times to avoid funneling. Perhaps the wrapper was too moist and I should have dry-boxed it for a day.Flavor :  It took some time to properly light the Duke but in the end I was rewarded with respectful portions of fresh, spicy smoke. The cedary flavors are not very powerful and provoke a pleasant tingling in the back of the throat. Little evolution until the end of the second third where I detect the addition of leather flavors. Until the very end (I let it rest when the burn arrived to the main band) there is also a faint taste of ammonia which indicates that this cigar might need a few additional years of aging.Value :  Ranging from $10 to $20 depending on the country and/or the retailer, it's hard to judge the value of this stick. Is it a box purchase? Not for me, for several reasons - I will outline them below.Overall Rating :  I have written several times that I have never been impressed with a single smoke from Romeo y Julieta. Well, sorry to repeat, but it's again the case here - whereas the Duke unquestionably has great looks and an acceptable construction, it doesn't deliver in terms of flavor, especially if you paid over $15 for the smoke. Furthermore, a 54 ring gauge is almost ridiculous. On the other hand, this cigar has some ageing potential unlike the 2008 Cuaba. Although I enjoyed the Duke less than the Magnum 48, it might be a good idea to try at least one of these fat babies.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Coming with a specific request to review the smoke, I happily agreed to do so after it received some rest.  Long story short, the flavor of the smoke was fantastic but it was unfortunately plugged to the point that, less than halfway in, it had to be abandoned or face the inescapable likelihood that my head would implode had I tried to continue.  After informing the contest holder of the unfortunate occurrence he indicated that it was generally known about their construction flaws and despite my protests, he would send another.  After receiving the second cigar and putting it down for several months to rest at 65% Rh I decided to fashion a follow-up attempt at the Ramon Allones 8-9-8.The 8-9-8 sports the same band as other Ramon Allones products with a brown, red and white field accented by a wide metallic gold embossed boarder, lines and crest.  The simplicity and ruggedness of the band ties into the wrapper\u2019s style perfectly.  Seams, small veins and some chipping are all visible on the earthen hued wrapper although none of them are a cause for concern.  An almost undetectable layer of oil coats the wrapper down to its perfect triple cap.  Pinch testing proves that the filler is firm with not a single soft spot that easily returns to its cylinder shape.Cutting the cap reveals an opening void of stems.  Soft and pleasant, it smells familiar and enjoyable; perhaps of leather.  The prelight draw is mild with a grilled steak and raspberry flavor.  Excitement builds as I recall how delightful the raspberry was in the first sample and toast the foot to a glowing red ember.   Initial draws are rather restrictive but not as tight as the previous attempt and the hope is that the heat will help it loosen more.  Incredible from the start, vanilla and leather work to make themselves known.  A slight spiced tingle on the tongue brings them out further but does not dominate.At about one inch in, the draw is still tight but appears workable.  The same flavors maintain throughout and I cannot help but think this smoke would go perfectly with a nice cup of full city roasted coffee.  Progressing into the second inch, it becomes apparent that the draw is taking a toll on the burn as one side is significantly faster than the other.  Working to rotate, wet, and even out the burn rewards me with a cigar that extinguished itself.  Tapping the ash, relighting and purging brings this one back from the dead.  Here the spice becomes more complete and an apple wood undertone becomes evident. After a few puffs, progressing through the next inch proves even more of a struggle than the last.  The canoeing returns and this smoke had to be relit multiple times.  This was even after making a cut of the foot to remove about one half of an inch in the hopes that the blockage was further down in the cigar.To my chagrin, I set the cigar aside and contemplate my experiences.  Overall this is probably one of the more disappointing cigars I have had.  It is not because it does not live up to any hype or that I expected something more.  What made this so hard to stomach is the fact that some of the most balanced and enjoyable flavors were presented but on both occasions, were forced to be abandoned well before their pinnacle.  If there were a way to guarantee that smoking another would yield a reliable construction, then I would not hesitate simply for the flavor alone.  Unfortunately this is not the case and unless you have the money to risk it, I would recommend finding a more reliable cigar to spend your time with.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : This post was written by Joe K.

Two 'Illy' double espressos in the second (no I ain't gonna sleep tonight), and alternated between a bit of whiskey and filtered water on the last (in hindsight water alone would have been just fine).Appearance :  The Epicure is in general a very nice looking cigar with a beautiful dark brown wrapper. I really like the Monterrey band, and the Epicure Especial double band is quite well done. Habanos SA seems to have realised this, and is now also offering the Epicure No. 2 in the same double band format for its 2009 production. The wrapper for this particular Especial was quite smooth with a very toothy binder showing through, just a bit too toothy in fact... - half a star.\u00a0 Construction :  The burn was just about a quarter inch uneven throughout. Probably, I smoked this cigar a bit too avariciously. It still lasted a good 80 minutes, even though I ended up butting it out a bit less than an inch before the end (more on that later).The ash was quite solid, and not too flaky, falling off only twice during the entire length, and the second time due to my dropping it (yes, I had started on the whiskey by then). I have seen much better constructed Especials than this, and probably I am being a bit too harsh on my rating here, but I will give this particular Especial 3.5 stars.Flavor :  The wrapper smelled of spices and earth. Pre-draw was both herbacious and earthy. Upon light up there is a short spicy bang. There is also a very fine Cuban twang, particular to the HdM line, which lasts evenly throughout the cigar's length. Woody undertones soon surface as well as slight hints of earth and mushrooms. Quite a bit of smoke is produced, and one gets the impression of there being a lot of depth to this cigar. The after-taste is pleasant and herby.In the second third both, cocoa and spice with a chili-like, though mild flavour, made their appearance. The earthy tones started to come out more as well. In the last third, the spicy tones faded and the earthy and mushroom flavours came to the fore. Unfortunately, in the last 6th the flavours faded out almost completely leaving just the twang and a simple tobacco taste. This has not happened to me with other Especials, but this one loses a star. I butted out three quarters of an inch or more before the nub due to the general lack of flavour. I strongly believe even just a bit of aging would correct this problem. The cigar was never harsh.Value :  As stated previously, I personally feel this is really one of the best values you can get at this size.Overall Rating :  This is and remains one of my preferred Cuban Robusto Extras. If you like Medium bodied cigars, you will not be disapointed. For those who like alot of spice and power in their cigars, you may be better served elsewhere like with the Trinidad Robusto Extra I recently reviewed (though it is far from being in the same price range).", "flavor": " The wrapper smelled of spices and earth.

Habanos Specialist is a label created by Habanos SA to distinguish shops that carry a wide selection of Cubans and can offer relevant advice. There are more than 500 Habanos Specialists worldwide.The Connossieur A is available in boxes of 25 and is costs around 12 \u20ac each in Europe.

The cedar has fallen to the backdrop, with the earth coming to the foreground along with cinnamon and leather.By the final third, the burn issues seem to have gone away, with the cedar and earth in the foreground.  The other flavors from the first and second thirds are present as well, including the white pepper, caramel, and also some tea which started to show up during the second third.

I smoked a few when they were very young and gifted a couple others. I set aside 15 for the sole purpose of aging them. They were fantastic when I bought them so I was really looking forward to tasting them after two years in my humidor.  Robustos are generally my preferred vitola so I was eager to have a go. Short and sweet, before I get into the review let me tell you that I was absolutely floored with this cigar and I will not hesitate in buying more.Appearance :  The cigar looks rustic.

The draw was absolutely perfect and getting a ton of smoke was effortless. The burn was even and it burned at a very comfortable rate, remaining consistent and never requiring any touchup or re-lighting.   The cigar was nicely rolled with no soft spots.Flavor :  What can I say? ... This 2 year old sample was absolutely amazing.  The pre-light aroma had some cedar tones and sweet tobacco scents. The pre-light draw was sweet, easy and mouth watering.  I just knew it was going to be a good smoke and I couldn\u2019t wait to toast the foot and dive right into it.The cigar started with some cedar tones with a cracked pepper finish.  Right off the bat the flavours were full bodied.  I did not need to wait to get bold flavours from this cigar. The peppery \u201chit\u201d that I received on ignition didn\u2019t last long at all and it quickly gave way to hints of black cherry and honey sweetened coffee with some mild nutty undertones that made their appearance after approximately 1 cm.  The cigar remained sweet with small hints of salt on the lips for the first third.  The best way to describe the sweetness of this cigar would be \u201ccreamy sweet\u201d often tasting like a very rich and creamy cappuccino sweetened with a touch of honey.I cannot get over the amount of velvety smoke put out by this cigar.   The Smoke was very thick and given I likened the tobacco taste to that of a sweet cappuccino, perhaps then the best way to describe the smoke would be like smoking the froth from that aforementioned cappuccino.Both the smoke and more importantly the cigar remained cool, never heating up despite the fact that I smoked this cigar a bit quicker than I normally do.   I had a few unflattering cigars in the days leading up to this one which is why perhaps I felt so rewarded with this one.  I felt that the flavours, while extremely pleasing and noticeable with each and every draw, didn\u2019t last long though and perhaps that short finish contributed to me taking more frequent puffs than I normally would. In any event, I can\u2019t remember having a Cuban cigar recently that yielded so much smoke, and tasty creamy smoke at that.I did come across a very mild and short lived bitterness near the midpoint of the cigar (perhaps because of the aforementioned rate at which I was smoking it) but this did not last long.  The hint of bitter black coffee experienced at the halfway point quickly gave way again to sweet coffee, honey and black cherry flavours with the occasional nutty and very subtle pepper undertones.  I did get hints of salt throughout the smoke but the sweetness of the cigar in general balanced those flavours beautifully.The final third was absolutely mouth watering. By then the flavours were blended perfectly.  I got so fascinated by the re-emergence of the strong sweetness that I forced the cigar a tad much and was punished with a hot and bitter final draw.  (Not the cigar\u2019s fault but my own)  In my view this cigar should be smoked until you reach just beyond the band (after removing it of course) and should not be forced to the nub no matter how much you are enjoying it or it will bite you with heat and bitterness and let\u2019s face it, we all hate having an extremely pleasurable cigar experience ruined because we forced the smoke for too long.  Lay it to rest once you get beyond the band and savour the experience you just had.  The finish does get a bit longer near the end of the cigar.Ramon Allones Specially Selected didn\u2019t overpower me with heavy nicotine and in that regard it was medium strength. Mind you, I did enjoy it on a full stomach after a hearty steak dinner. It is certainly full-bodied in flavour and aroma.  It is a Robusto after all so I still recommend it be smoked after dinner or with something in your stomach.  Don\u2019t be fooled by the chocolaty goodness of the cigar.  This cigar can creep up on you near the end.If there is one thing that I still cannot get over after smoking this cigar, it is the sheer volume of smoke it exhaled.Value :  I travel to Cuba often enough (or have friends that do) where I can re-stock as needed.

Upmann cigars...Who has not heard of Cuban cigars?  Long touted as producing the pinnacle in quality cigars, that small island has made quite a name for itself.  Determined to see if they could live up to the hype, I set out on trying one of the most consistently enjoyed sticks available, the H. Upmann Magnum 46.On sight this stick is very attractive.  Its gorgeous cocoa colored wrapper has an evenly oiled sheen.  The ruggedness is brought out by a consistent amount of veins although none of them are overly imposing.  A slight wrinkled appearance gives the wrapper some character but does not detract from the overall look or construction.  Beautifully complimented by the simple red and gold embossed band it is very striking.Cleanly cutting through the cigar\u2019s triple cap releases prelight flavors of a slight sweetness with mild pepper tone.  Upon lighting this gives way to butter and spice.  Earth notes join the party with a subtle mint undertone.  As the cigar fades into an almost nutty flavor I cannot help but admire the construction.  A razor burn and excellent draw leave behind a wake of solid gray ash. Although it is a bit dry of a smoke, the consistently changing flavors are able to be brought out by drinking some quality H2O every once in a while.Moving into the second third unleashes a spice burst for a while but fades back into nuttiness.  Mild hints of ginger linger after this change, which continues into the half way mark.  At about the halfway point the ash comes off for the first time.  The spiciness takes charge again and overcomes most other flavors.  After a short while it subsides just enough to let a mild sweetness, perhaps vanilla, show itself.  Despite the sweetness this cigar does finish out its course with a healthy amount of spice, which was not the most enjoyable aspect of this smoke.Solid construction and an outstanding appearance make the cigar easy to look but the flavor is what knocks you away.  Typically I gravitate towards cigars with complex flavors that maintain a solid baseline and this stick fits that bill to a \u201cT\u201d.  The spice serves to tie the entire smoke together while the nuttiness, earth, ginger and vanilla add excitement.  Although I have had other non-Cuban cigars that surpass this, the H. Upmann Magnum 46 is truly an amazing experience.  Throughout this entire cigar I kept reveling in the fact that I have four more of these waiting in my humidor to try in future years.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (4.25)This post was written by Joe K.

Enjoy.I will not bore you with the history of the Cohiba marca as it is already so well known.  In addition, a lot has already been written about this particular vitola from Cohiba which is among one of its most popular.  It is viewed by many as one of the best Robustos in the world, and has gone a long way towards popularizing this format.  I recently purchased a box, and upon their arrival I noticed they were already over a year old.

That grassy flavor is very pronounced, and sets you up for exactly what you would expect from this cigar.  In the first-third the cigar started with a medium profile right away with the taste of sweet grass, some tobacco and leather.  In a word\u2026 awesome.  The second-third offered the same grassy aroma, but the sweetness disappeared to be replaced with a hint of black pepper.  I personally like the pepper and expect it in a CoRo.  In the final-third, the cigar was picking up to a medium-full in terms of body.  The grassy aroma went away, but the pepper remained along with the flavor of tobacco.  At this point it was not evolving as I expected it to.  The cigar also began to get a bit harsh and the bitterness was steadily developing.

Online or offline, they are only available at several retailers for a simple reason - they were made specifically for La Casa del Habanos outlets. If you are interested in the history of this cigar, you might want to read this article - this is pretty fascinating. Thanks to a good friend of mine, I was able to put my hand on a sample so, without further ado, here is my opinion on this smoke.Appearance :  Salomones is one beautiful perfecto and is almost intimidating because of its size. It sports a larger than usual Partagas band and a second LCDH band. I haven't encountered many cigars of this shape, but those that I did were always stunningly attractive. Unfortunately the first picture doesn't do it justice - but when you're turning the cigar in your hands you just can't help admiring the skills of the roller who produced it.Construction :  What I love about the perfectos is that they are damn easy to light. You just point the flame to the narrow foot, wait a couple of seconds and that's it! Well, this was not the case here. I had quite a hard time lighting the Salomones...

I was served with an uneven burn and a loose draw which resulted - weird - in very little smoke. Despite the fact that my opinion about the roller I mentioned earlier changed, I can't say that the construction ruined the smoke - it was just mediocre.Flavor :  The flavors are almost overwhelming in the beginning. There is spice, there is wood and, of course, there is earth - have you had a Partagas without those heavy earthy flavors? Given its size, I should probably divide the cigar in quarters; each of those required approximately 25 minutes to go through. 7 inches is no joke. So, in the first quarter, the cigar was just waking up. Nothing exceptional, medium-bodied. The second quarter was more interesting, the spice, as expected, made its retreat to the background while earthy, leathery and woody flavors took front positions. Progressively, other flavors made their appearance - nuts and coffee were spotted at the transition point between the 2nd and the 3rd quarter. Again, as expected, the spice made its way back in the last quarter and I felt a considerable increase in power. Don't stand up sharply when you're done with this smoke.Value :  I did feel some ageing potentiel here. It is also necessary to determine whether the construction issues I encountered are recurrent.

Before that, however, I was predominantly a smoker of  figurado cigars.  I am quite familiar with the old go-to cigar in this vitola, the Montecristo No. 2, but there are many other figurado cigars that rank just as high if not better. Among this particular vitola, I have preferences and they are the H. Upmann No. 2 and the Partagas Series P. No. 2.  After having focused on smoking some of the Upmann No. 2s lately, I thought I would reach into my humidor and pull out a Partagas from my 2009 box given that I had not had one in a while.  I remember smoking this cigar when it was young.  It wasn\u2019t bad but it could have used some additional age.  With over 3 years of age on it now, I feel the time is right to start enjoying these. So how did the Series P No. 2 score?Appearance :  (4.25) The cigar had a nice dark wrapper with an elegant rustic look.  There were some reddish spots over the wrapper.

Despite being bigger than the Series D No. 4, the cigar actually felt lighter in my hand and given that the D No. 4 is one of my favorite cigars, I am quite familiar with its feel.Flavor :  The cigar itself was very \"Partagas\" but not as strong in body or nicotine content as say for instance the Series D No. 4.  It is less peppery than most Partagas but still has that distinctive peppery zest combined with a perfect salty-sweet balanced tobacco flavour.The first third reminded me why I love this vitola.  Super thick clouds of cool smoke loaded with obvious Cuban tobacco flavors.  The smoke was thick and velvety and had a caramel nectar texture to it.  The finish had some faint pepper and some very pleasing cocoa and leather notes. That distinctive Cuban saltiness on the palate greeted me immediately and stayed with me for the duration of the cigar. For an extra peppery blast I exhaled through my nose.As I approached the second third some notes of dried fruit with a hint of citrus appeared on the front of the palate with some light cedar and pepper lingering on the back of the tongue and throat. As I noted earlier, the pepper was there but not distracting.  It seemed that each puff offered something different with instances of leather and coffee creeping into the flavour profile.  The smoke remained lush and creamy.The cigar continued to burn flawlessly as I started the final third of the cigar. The ash remained thick, firm and had a nice aged grey color to it. I would help it off every two inches or so but it would have probably held longer. The final third offered up hints of sweet coffee, citrus with cedar and leather notes.  The smoke volume was still there but it wasn\u2019t as creamy or velvety as it was during the first half of the cigar. The cigar did take on a little more pepper than the first half of the cigar but again, it was relatively mild compared to some other cigars in this vitola, namely the Montecristo No. 2.  The flavors did start to take on slight bitterness shortly after removing the band and it was at that stage where I put the cigar to rest not wanting to ruin the experience.  All in all, age did this cigar wonders.Value :  If purchased in Cuba, you can\u2019t go wrong with this cigar.

A full seven inches of cigar, with the golden Churchill's band in conjunction with the classic RyJ red band glued around a perfect chocolate brown wrapper is a sight to behold. \u00a0 Construction :  Very well filled, perhaps just a bit tight. Reasonably even burn, and solid ash.Flavor :  Despite the very masculine image of Sir Winston, I would class this as a rather feminine cigar. The typical floral and cedar RyJ flavours are present but better balanced than many other vitolas in the range. The Churchill starts out quite mild but is very enjoyable, the first two thirds do not develop very much, but it is a pleasant zen-like experience, requiring time and patience. Despite the imposing length, and perhaps because of it, this is a perfect beginner's cigar. It looks great between the lips of one's significant other. I tested my Churchill out on my wife (sorry), and she thought it was one of the best tasting cigars she had ever tried.Just as you get to the famous golden band, and your partner is probably butting it out, the Churchill starts to develop quite a bit of spice and promises a great ending. Very unfortunately, as I removed the red band and was on the last two inches, I most reluctantly had to butt it out because it became harsh without any redeeming qualities in terms of flavour. Yes, quite frustrating. My conclusion is that this is not a cigar you can smoke out of the box, and it requires at least two to three years of aging. Most probably, the strength found in the last third or so would spread through-out the length of the cigar, and the harshness would disapear.Value :  For its length, this is a very reasonably priced cigar. If you smoke it young though, you will probably butt it out early.Overall Rating :  I am rather unforgiving when it comes to the final third on any cigar, youth and good looks or not. So I personally can't really say that I would smoke this cigar again, even though the first two thirds were very pleasant and relaxing. With two or three years in the humidor, I can imagine this cigar taking on the qualities that so pleased the Prime Minister.", "flavor": " Despite the very masculine image of Sir Winston, I would class this as a rather feminine cigar.

It is the fifth \u201cvolume\u201d of the Habanos Collection Series which began in 2001.  The Colecci\u00f3n releases are notable for both quality and the unique presentation (see photographs).I meant to smoke and review this in the summer, but just never got to it.  I purchased this \u201cbook\u201d at initial release and have smoked a few.  I recall enjoying these, but not being blown away.  Now that we are into its 9th year, I thought it was a good time to see how they are developing.  Reviewing this on a cold, rainy night while sitting next to an aromatic fire, paired with a very dry, gin martini (my preferred libation with Montecristos and Cohibas).Appearance :  Natural (between Claro and Colorado Claro), very flat sheen, no perceptible flaws.  While I\u2019ve smoked many Maravillas vitolas, this still feels surprisingly huge.

The only negative is that, given its size, I\u2019d have expected any Maravillas to last significantly over two hours, but it only made it to an hour and forty-five minutes.Flavor :  Pre-light aroma is nearly nonexistent.  The cigar opens very mild, with a blend of light cedar, hay and leather as the initial flavors.  A touch of caf\u00e9 a lait.   If I didn\u2019t know better, I would have thought it a well aged, lesser Cohiba with muted flavors.  Wonderful, but too mild.If I could condense the taste and double its strength it would be an incredible cigar, but I\u2019m having to work too hard to discern the flavor components.  Expelling it through the nose reflects more of the same; very smooth, but no spice.  An inch or so in, I get a bit of tea as well.  This cigar has a relatively short finish.  Towards mid-smoke, the flavors have strengthened quite a bit (whew!).  Same flavors, hay and tea becoming more dominant, perhaps a hint of black pepper.  Typically, I equate tea with tannins which indicate aging potential, and so despite the mild first half, I think a few more years will improve this cigar, but it will never be a flavor bomb.Towards the last third, there is no question of this cigar\u2019s Montecristo roots; it is quite similar in profile to a late-90s Monte #2.Overall Rating :  (3.75) Milder than I expected or remembered, the Montecristo Colecci\u00f3n Habanos 2005 had the characteristics of a 20+ year old cigar in the first half.

As I wrote in a precedent comment I have a little project to compare the actual cuban cigars production and relative brand, shape and vitolas, with the same cigar hand made before 2003. This is a virtual cut off related at time of aging almost ten years and becouse in the last ten years many thing about habanos changed. More realistic I think that the beginning of great changes in habanos world was more or less about last yeears of last century. Nevertheless in the case of H.Upmann Robusto in regular production of this famous brand (one of my favourite) never was made a vitola de galera robusto (ring gauge 50, lenght 124 mm.), the H. Upmann cigar that more is similar to size to this new robusto is the Connoisseur N.1 a vitola de galera named Hermosos n.4 (ring gauge 48, lenght 127) also named with a common name of corona extra. The differences in size with a robusto are very little, so becouse I have in my humidor a wood box of Connoisseur N.1 made in 1999 (in that period withot anilla) I smoke one of these cigars and I write my impression. If I find a new H.Upmann Robusto L.E. 2012 I try to compare this two cigars in the purpose of my little \u201csperimental\u201d project. Bye. A.

My cigar is classic Colorado, with optimal construction and aroma of aged tobacco with note of leiither, after lightning normal smoke output with acid and spicy notes, smoking the first impression is a cigar with strong-medium intensity, spicy taste with  peanuts and ginger flavour. During smoking cigar has a good costant combustion. The taste become more decise from second half with note of wood, less spicy always with a little  bit acid note mixed with dark chocolate smell in the end this cigars became mote decise and variable typical character  of HU cigar. In my opinion this aged Conoosseur N.1 seems a little version of Double Corona EL 2001 one of the best cigar never produced by H.Upmann brand.

Upmann cigars...The Ediciones Limitadas are released every year and are manufactured with carefully selected wrapper, filler and binder tobaccos which have been aged for a period of at least 2 years. The wrapper for these cigars comes from the top leaves of the Tapado \u2013 shade-grown black Cuban tobacco plant, and is a relevant characteristic that identifies these special productions. This wrapper is usually darker than the wrappers of regular range sizes of the brand and this is immediately noticeable to anyone who smokes H. Upmann cigars like I do.The Ediciones Limitadas are made with the finest tobacco leaves coming from Vuelta Abajo and also feature long filler from that region. Since my favorite vitola is the Robusto, I was intrigued by the H. Upmann 2012 Edicion Limitada Robusto.  This is a size that does not exist in the regular production run of H. Upmann Cigars.

I\u2019ve given them slightly over a year to stabilize and rest a little in my humidor.The pre-light aroma of the cigar was sublime. It offered up a very pleasing bouquet of sweet cedar, earthy tobacco and that unmistakable tobacco aroma one gets from a fine Cuban cigar.   The pre-light draw was perfect and offered more sweet wood notes with some nice salt on the lips.  Just a hint of pepper was noticed and I was able to pick up  earthy notes, tea, dried fruit and cocoa.Lighting the cigar greets you with tremendous smoke output and an unmistakable Cuban salty twang on the lips.  The front of the palate is hit with sweet oak notes with some caramel and leather with a kick of cracked black pepper spice at the back end. Definitely enough spice to let you know it\u2019s there but not enough to get in the way of the flavors.The first third offered a rich smoke, a little drier than the usual velvety smoke of regular production Upmanns but there was still some sweet honey-like residue on the palate. Primary flavors were of oak with sweet earthy notes and hints of caramel and leather. Hints of toasted nuts and roasted coffee beans were present on the occasional puff. A perfect amount of black pepper on the back of the palate with a pleasing salty residue on the lips helped  balance all the flavors.By the end of the first third the smoke took on a more familiar creamy, velvety texture that the Upmanns are known for.  Flavor-wise, the second third offered much of the same flavors but they became bolder and more definable.  There were a little more woodsy notes and bolder bursts of cocoa and coffee.  Every puff revealed something new. There was still some pepper on the medium finish.  As I passed the halfway mark the cigar took on more earthy notes but still had some cocoa and coffee.The final third offered yet another transition as the cigar got sweeter again with more hints of chocolate, espresso and leather. It continued to offer up notes of sweet oak and the smoke, while not as velvety, still had sweet residue to it. There was still some black pepper spice in the finish and some pleasing saltiness on the front of the palate.  Each puff, so it seemed, hit you with a salty tingle on the lips with a variety of flavors. It was the first cigar in a while that I truly smoked down to the nub.Value :  At $18.00 a cigar these aren\u2019t cheap BUT this is what to expect when purchasing Cuban cigars outside of the Island these days.

It\u2019s not the smoothest wrapper in the world, but it does have a beautiful dark color to it.  The band shows some age and the size is a Corona Gorda which is my favorite vitola.The foot of the cigar smells really peppery and the wrapper smells a little sweet and cedary. Checking the the draw, it left a little bit of oak and peppery taste on my palate. Only thing left is to light it up. Shall we?COFFEE. Are you kidding me? This is the most distinct coffee flavor I\u2019ve tasted in any cigar, Cuban or Non-Cuban. Wow, the first puffs of this cigar are exactly 100% the taste of coffee. I was really amazed because I know we mention \u201ccoffee-like\u201d flavors, but this is 100% COFFEE. For the rest of the cigar, I got plenty of the same coffee flavors, especially on the aftertaste. Then I got some sweet earthy tones mixed with a toasty oaky flavor. And surprise, surprise, it's smooth! I'm really digging the smoothness I get from Cubans compared to that \u201cfeel it in your throat\u201d taste I get from a lot of non-Cuban cigars.There was one problem, the draw. It was a little tighter then what I would want it to be and because of the tight draw, I was getting burn problems with this cigar a little past the second third. The ash was grey and very flaky, but held up pretty well.When talking about Cuban cigars you probably won't hear \u201cSaint Luis Rey\u201d too much. Which is probably a good thing because now I can get them all for myself. Whether or not the age in this cigar is better than what they produce now, we\u2019ll find out soon.

The spice does not completely disappear, however, and will be present throughout the smoke. The second third is what I prefer in this cigar as the smoke is thick and creamy with flavors of hazelnut and latte.

Enjoy!Why review a special release cigar which is no longer available for purchase, and yet not old enough to be considered vintage?  Because it\u2019s there.  I typically smoke two cigars a day and have been for nearly twenty years.  While I enjoy each and every cigar, the process of reviewing them provides me unique focus and delivers conclusions beyond simply \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d.Appearance :  Natural (Colorado Claro), flat sheen, numerous prominent veins.

Left unattended, the cigar remained lit much long than the typical Cuban cigar.  Dense enough to last a full two hours.Flavor :  Opens mild, with leather as the dominant flavor.

There is a long lasting black pepper finish to each puff.  Towards mid-smoke, the flavors have melded together well into a very pleasant, albeit simple, profile.  The black pepper finish has given way to the dominance of the leather, which coats the tongue.   There are no traces of floral, fruit or nut flavors - just leather, wood, salt and black pepper.  This cigar has a remarkably long finish.Overall Rating :  When these were first released, most enthusiasts were disappointed at the mild, nearly dull flavor, especially considering the very high price point at the time.  I had purchased two cabinets and smoked through the first cabinet quickly as a result of incorrectly presuming that they would not develop further and had been an acquisition mistake on my part.  I cracked into the second cabinet a few months ago and was shocked at how much of a positive difference the additional six years had made.  Because of the mild nature of the Bolivar Colosales, the choice of pairing beverage is critical.  I began with coffee (coffee brought out the dominance of leather) and moved to water and then to a Bruichladdich scotch (scotch and gin highlight the saltiness and bring out the best in this cigar).The cigar is a delight, but the price point was simply too high.  In my opinion, Habanos gave us better special release alternatives in 2006 with the Ramon Allones Estupendos Edici\u00f3n Regional, the Cohiba Piramides Edici\u00f3n Limitadas and the Partagas Serie D Especial Edici\u00f3n Limitadas.  On a point scoring basis, the Bolivar Colosales has aged into a 4 of 5.", "flavor": " Opens mild, with leather as the dominant flavor.

Upmann cigars...I'm really falling in love with H. Upmann cigars lately. Magnum 46 must be my favorite corona gorda and its bigger brother, the majestic Magnum 50 is a really delicious grand/double robusto. With unbeatable looks and construction, this recently introduced smoke will definitely find its followers.Appearance :  When I'm smoking this one outside, I am always catching some respectful looks. The Magnum 50 is really huge (16 cm / 6.3 in) and impressive. Furthermore, it is simply beautiful with its colorado wrapper and a stylish red double band.Construction :  These probably have the most consistent construction among all the Cubans that I've smoked for a long time. Razor-sharp burn, comfortable draw and thick, silver-white smoke.\u00a0 Flavor :  The pre-draw only seems woody at first, but you get a powerful spicy after-taste that makes you apprehend the first puffs. Rich and powerful, they don't disappoint, bringing an overwhelming mix of cedar and black pepper that lasts about an inch before smoothening out. The tempo is irregular and entertaining. As the second third approaches, I make out coffee and chocolate flavors, smooth and creamy. The end is mostly roasted coffee and it lacks a little complexity, that's why I didn't give it a 5/5. However, the finish is plesant and totally satisfying.Value :  Not a cheap smoke, although the price is correct for a quality Cuban.Overall Rating :  H. Upmann Magnum 50 matched my expectations. Although the ones I smoked were quite young (JUN 08), I didn't find them 'green' at all. I will be keeping some in my humidor to see how these will improve with age.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

This cigar has been reviewed many times because of its popularity. I wanted to share my own experience with this cigar.  This sample came from a 25-count box purchased in Cuba earlier this year. It carries a box date of December 2011.Appearance :  Usually the most popular cigars that come out of Cuba suffer some construction issues because of demand.  Despite the popularity of this cigar, I was pleased to find that the construction was exceptional. The slightly darker than Colorado shade wrapper had a nice sheen to it and was firm to the touch with no visible imperfections or tangible soft spots. The cap was nicely applied and the double band gave the cigar a very classy look. It had two very prominent veins that ran the length of the cigar which resulted in the half star deduction. The pre-draw had earthy tones with some hints of cedar. The pre-light aroma was very pleasing, woodsy/earthy with a sweet undertone.Construction :  The cigar held nicely during the smoke.  No wrapper issues to report.  The draw was a tad firm to start but by the first cm or so it opened up beautifully and was never an issue the rest of the way.  The Epicure No. 2 let off a great volume of smoke and the brownish/white ash was firm, lasting well over an inch at the beginning but became more flaky around the midway point.  The burn was dead even and very impressive.  Note the even burn after I removed the first of this double banded cigar. If I had one issue is that I did have to apply some flame to the cigar after the second band was removed to keep it lit. Not a big issue but enough from keeping this cigar from getting a perfect score when coupled with the aforementioned tight draw to start.Flavor :  Despite the cigar still being relatively young, I didn\u2019t get any hints of ammonia.  I often say that the beauty of Hoyo cigars is that they can be smoked on an empty stomach without fear of experiencing any nicotine related issues. Novice smokers though are always advised to ensure they have a full stomach when smoking robustos simply because they can creep up on you. Let us not mistake it however. What it lacked in nicotine punch was more than adequately compensated by full-bodied flavour. As such, while this is not an overwhelmingly strong cigar, it is extremely full-bodied in flavour.The smoke coming off the cigar at every puff was sweet and very velvety; feeling at times like it was leaving a bit of caramel on my tongue. The pleasing sweetness made my mouth water. I was immediately greeted with a very pleasant sweetness and hints of white pepper. Soon after lighting I noticed the emergence of coffee flavours with some hints of tea leaf and white pepper. I picked up some mild salt on my lips and palate that remained discernible the entire length of the cigar. I did not mind this though because it served to beautifully balance the sweetness of the cigar. As I approached the end of the first third I found that the sweet coffee like flavour became more chocolaty sweet with hints of cocoa and dark chocolate emerging. Occasional undertones of cedar and pepper continued to be noticeable.By the final third the cigar really started to show outstanding characteristics. The velvety smoke continued to have hints of sweet coffee that complimented the slightly salty and peppery finish.  Hints of dark chocolate remained as did some cedar undertones but the overall finish of the cigar was sweet and long and left me feeling extremely satisfied.Overall the Epicure No. 2 was very balanced and showed signs of complexity with a few very discernible and pleasurable flavour changes. These subtle changes are what keeps a cigar from being one dimensional. The texture of the smoke remained consistent and provided the cigar with the sweetness it needed to keep the white pepper, occasional bitterness and subtle saltiness in check. I wish all my cigars would have as much smoke per puff as this one does.If I had to best describe the flavour journey the cigar went from sweet coffee tones to dark unsweetened chocolate, hints of cedar and hints of tea. A pleasing mild salt and pepper was evident throughout serving to nicely balance the sweetness of this very flavourful cigar.It\u2019s easy to see why this robusto is one of the more highly rated and popular cigars in this vitola. On a personal note, I would prefer just a little more strength to this fantastic cigar.  Strength is subjective and personal however therefore it does not affect my flavour rating.Value :  As with most Cuban cigars, these can get a little pricey depending on your source. This cigar is truly in the league of the Partagas Serie D No. 4 (Perhaps one of the best robustos on the market) with a more subdued nicotine punch. The flavours are very enjoyable, the construction is solid and it is easy to see why this cigar remains one of the most popular robustos to come off the Island. The bouquet is extremely satisfying and it has a very nice long finish. I purchased mine on the Island and paid $142.50 (Cuban Pesos) for a box of 25. At that price ($5.70 Cuban pesos per cigar) they are a steal but we all know that in the real world that isn\u2019t the price that most readers will pay. I have seen them sell for as little as $9.50 (un-verified online sources) to as much as $24.00 per cigar here in tax happy Canada but these cigars can be found in the $13-$16.00 range. In my opinion they are definitely worth having in your humidor and are priced very competitively compared to other top robustos. Shop around because I am sure you can get them for a decent price.Overall Rating :  This is perhaps one of the most flavourful robustos on the market. Thankfully, construction hasn\u2019t been affected despite the cigar\u2019s popularity. This is a cigar that can be enjoyed early in the day by more seasoned smokers and is one that novice smokers should enjoy to see what a complex and flavourful cigar should taste like. There is always space set aside in my humidor for these flavour bombs.", "flavor": " Despite the cigar still being relatively young, I didn\u2019t get any hints of ammonia.

I am a big fan of the Ramon Allones marca and of the grand corona vitola. It was only right for me to do a review of this cigar.Appearance :  My sample is a great looking cigar.

The draw is exactly how I like it, clean with some resistance.Flavor :  1st third The Superiores is starting off slowly by giving me a nice amount of smoke. This is a medium-bodied cigar with silky smooth smoke. I get some milk chocolate flavors.  It is almost like the powder you put in milk to make chocolate milk. The finish is short and light but pleasant. There is a nice creaminess to it that I really like. It shows some vegetal flavors buried in the back that hopefully will pop out later on.2nd third The second third is following up nicely. It has the same milk chocolate taste but adds notes of coffee and grilled nuts. This is great, tons of flavors and a good amount of smoke. It is still smooth and silky but the amount of smoke has thinned out. Maybe it is because the cigar isn\u2019t burning properly. This cigar doesn\u2019t have the Ramon Allones profile you expect find in a Specially Selected but it is pretty damn good.3rd third The body is picking slowly to a medium/full body. Still no sign of the marca\u2019s signature stewed fruits flavors but a good mix of chocolate, coffee, hazelnuts and hints of vegetal notes. This is one to keep.Value :  I think these are great and well-priced. They come in 10-count boxes and are readily available.

There is a slight grass taste to this smooth and lush smoke. When my friend said they were on, he wasn\u2019t lying; these aren\u2019t your typical Montecristo 4\u2019s. This one is a light medium body, has a sweet type of taste, like a salty caramel. And it is excellent. The end of the first third\u2019s taste is turning to a sweet cherry.2nd third We continue with the same sweetness lingering in the back and it is followed by toast flavours. The body is going over light medium to medium. The aftertaste is impeccable. It leaves a satisfying sweet salty caramel taste. The burn is a bit all over the place. I need to correct it but I don\u2019t mind. This cigar is giving me so much that I can\u2019t complain.3rd third There are some ins and outs of mushrooms. That is surprising but the flavour is clear and defined. First time I get something like this. It has slowed down and is back to light medium body. At the very end, I get the cherry flavour back in again for a classy finish. This is a cigar you want to smoke all the way until the end.

This time it was a red one. Whereas some of the regional editions I tried were rather disappointing because of the lack of personality, others turned out to be outstanding. Bottom line - I don't mind trying my luck with REs. This is why I bought a couple of Punch Small Club when I was in Paris in April.Appearance :  At 4 x 50, this is a small robusto. For obvious reasons, I immediately thought about the Bolivar Petit Libertador that I sampled last year. I was secretly hoping that the stout cigar I was turning in my hands would have a different flavor profile, because I wasn't in the mood for a pepper bomb. After all, this is a Punch, so it shouldn't punch you in the face, right? I found the cigar attractive and surprisingly elegant for this size. The wrapper had no evident defects and the bands looked concordant.Construction :  Punch Small Club is as good as it can get in the construction department. No complaints whatsoever about the draw and, even more surprising for a Cuban cigar, the burn was razor sharp. I've been watching it closely and it never wandered out of its way. The ash was firm and held for 2 inches before I tapped it off.Flavor :  The cigar starts out with a moderate pepper blast, which quickly gives way to cedary flavors. Punch Small Club appears as a solid medium-bodied smoke. Very soon, I have a deja vu feeling and I recall the Punch Punch - the first third shares the same flavors with this corona gorda. However, things change rapidly and I detect some original flavors such as butter or gingerbread. Furthermore, the smoke is definitely more complex than an average Punch. The second third is amazing, full-flavored, with a long finish. There is a noticeable increase in power near the end as I am prompted to slow down. Reluctantly I let the cigar die when it starts burning my fingers. Lovely smoke.Value :  If these cigars are consistent, I'm going for a box. At $12 a pop, these are not a budget smoke, but in this case the quality commands a premium.Overall Rating :  I'll try to get a fiver soon. If they will turn out to be as good as the first two were, then I'll definitely get a box of those since their flavor profile is exactly what I'm looking for in a good cigar. I also like the size, especially in my current situation where I can't afford spending 2 hours with a churchill. If there are some people from France reading this blog, can you tell me how you found this cigar if you tried it?

Maybe that explains my affinity to cigars as well but I digress.  Recently, the wife, in-laws and I decided to have the 2010 summer initiation of their fire pit.  After getting it cleaned, lit and stabilized I found myself fully relaxed, tranquilly looking out across a golden field behind their home.  Deciding that it was the perfect setting for a special cigar I opened my humidor and set eyes upon a gift from a fellow BOTL and my next adventure; a 1998 Romeo y Julieta Cazadores.Admittedly, my experience with cigars from this region is minimal.  On inspection, the wrapper of this one looks rugged and imperfect but not sloppy.  There is a fair quantity of veins but nothing overly imposing.  A couple of seams have a slight wrinkle to them but all of them manage to hold fast and remain cleanly attached.  A couple of pencil eraser sized green water spots are intermittently dispersed along the barrel.  Age has done a wonderful job of bringing the oils to the surface creating a beautiful sheen on the light brown wrapper.  A distinct musty barnyard smell exudes from the foot and wrapper.Cutting the triple cap and gently toasting the foot reveals a tight draw that still manages to produce dense creamy smoke with a very grassy flavor leaving a subtle tingling on the tongue.  Taking a few more puffs unleashes light coffee.  The draw begins to loosen at this point leaving behind a dark gray ash.  First impressions of this cigar are that it is quite mild but remains flavorful enough.Moving into the second third, the cigar dispenses a short burst of white pepper when retrohaled through the nose.  Mostly, however, the overall profile is slightly bitter hay.  At about the halfway mark the burn begins to run off course and starts to canoe.  After wrestling with it for a short while, ashing the cigar and providing a touchup with my torch corrected the burn for the remainder of the smoke. Moving into the final third the light pepper becomes more prominent and is accompanied by a soft nutty tone and original hay flavor.Overall this smoke is incredibly mild.  Some flavor changes occur during the course of the smoke but grassy hay dominates throughout.  The question that kept popping into my mind every time a new flavor revealed itself is whether or not it was blended to be that subtle or if the twelve years of age had moved it past its prime.  If the flavors mentioned above, outside of the hay, were more dominant I think this would have been a much more enjoyable experience.  If this was a purchase instead of a gift I would not have been put out by paying the $7 price for this smoke but I would not actively seek out another.  An added point worth mentioning is that this cigar was stored at 70% RH so reducing that prior to smoking may have helped the overall flavor.  I will likely get a chance to smoke one more of these and plan to let it rest at 65% or slightly lower beforehand.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating :  (3.25)This post was written by Joe K.

Upmann cigars...Many thanks to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric from La Casa del Habano Knokke (Belgium) for sending me these cigars for review! Check out the shop for a nice selection of Cubans.Released in the beginning of October 2011, H. Upmann Royal Robusto is a special edition cigar limited to La Casa del Habano stores worldwide. Only 5,000 boxes, each one containing 10 stogies, were created. I can now proudly say that I consumed 1/50000th of the total production, which means that this review is based on one sample only.

White, rock-solid and holds for well over 2 inches.Flavor :  The beginning is one of the best ones I ever experienced in a Cuban cigar. Instead of a simple spice kick, I get toasted notes which do contain spice but all the flavors are perfectly balanced. Surprisingly, the cigar doesn't taste young at this point (I'm fairly sure it was boxed in 2011). The spice, in fact, is simply perfect - entertaining and far from overwhelming. The flavors are so... meaty. The first third is also characterized by other spicy flavors like gingerbread and cinnamon.As I slowly (very slowly, see my remark about the burn above) transition into the second third, something changes. I need a minute to understand what's going on as I don't really expect this cigar to develop any sweetness. But here it is, raisins, dried apricots, honey... amazing. These flavors do not last very long though. Progressively, woody notes begin to dominate the flavor profile. From medium-bodied until this point, the Royal Robusto gets rather full-bodied in the beginning of the last third. This is where I feel the freshness of its tobacco - the flavor profile is rough around the edges with strong notes of leather. It stays this way until the very end.Value :  LCDH Knokke has them at 105 EUR/box of 10, which is a solid value in my book (they are out of stock as of now and available at pre-order).Overall Rating :  You might notice that I liked this cigar a lot.

Thank you Ray!Cigar Smoking is a social activity. Nothing compliments good food, drink and conversation than a cigar. I can think of no other cigar presentation that encourages being social more than Partagas Culebras. Culebras I am told means \u201csnake\u201d and this twisted, braid of a cigar trio is a conversation starter and a Cuban smoke not to be missed.The lore of why Culebras are braided together range from \u201cso employees could steal more cigars\u201d, to \u201cmaking it possible that employees couldn\u2019t sell their unique daily stipend of cigars on the black market\u201d. I tend to believe the legend that says \u201cthis is a marketing ploy.\u201d Whatever story you subscribe to the Culebras won\u2019t let you down.Appearance :  The Brown Colorado wrapper was soft and perfectly constructed except for how the cigar looks like a stretched spring.Construction :  These cigars are subject to some extreme wrapper manipulation and if you are going to make your cigars twisty and curly, then why not make \u2018em perfect\u2026 and they are. No construction flaws whatsoever.Now Culebras come in a dress box with 3 smaller coffins inside. Each coffin holds one braid. (so 3 cigars is one braid in a coffin, 3 coffins per box, That\u2019s 9 smokes for you keeping score at home.). I decided to share a coffin of these at my dad\u2019s 65th birthday party. Upon pulling out the cigars a small crowd gathered to hear the tales of how a Culebras becomes a Culebras. After some untying I passed out the cigars to my Dad, one of his friends and one for me. The number one question I got is do you smoke all three at once? I say there is noway to do that unless you want to smoke ribbon and band because that is all that holds this braid of Cuban goodness together.Flavor :  After cutting the end I took a few cold draws\u2026 perfect draw\u2026 as for flavor, nothing really, maybe the slightest hint of barnyard but no really distinct taste. I quickly toasted the foot and took a few draws. I was struck that the 1st third was a shot of spice and very mild earth, upon hitting the second third the flavor came on with very strong wood, cedar and the earth taste was still there.The spice hung on and stayed dominant. The final third was spicey, some leathery tones and very full-flavored, never overwhelming but a kick none the less. This stick will give you as much nicotine sting as you want in the final third. The grayish and black ash only lasted about an inch at a time.I think most would label this cigar medium-full. I also smoked it to within a half inch of its life.Value :  The Partagas Culebras was originally going to lose points for price. For me this was the trickiest thing to grade because as a straight up cigar it is expensive at about $13 dollars a stick but the experience makes the Partagas Culebras seem dirt cheap.

Partagas is a brand I love. When I saw this, collecting dust at the B&M, I figured it was worth a mere 6$ for a 10+ years old machine-made cigar from this famous marca.Appearance :  The wrapper is colorado, it is on the rough side but not the ugliest I have seen. The single cap looks good, same goes for the foot. The cigar has a slight box-press shape to it, I don\u2019t mind that at all. I've got to say that I am a fan of skinny cigars, this is a good size for a quick fix.  I rarely smoke machine-made cigars but this one looks all right when you\u2019re searching for something cheap and cheerful.Construction :  The cigar seems to be a little underfilled but it is still stiff. Hopefully the draw will be good and not too loose. The foot seems full and tight. The cigar feels nice in hand. After a clean cut, the draw is up to par. It is a little tight but barely. No complaints here.Flavor :  The pre-draw aroma is tobacco and light spices. It gives a little tingle on the tongue.1st third: Nice medium body, there is a good amount of smoke, spices, spicy cake, carrot cake through the nose. It leaves a long finish. There are some recognizable Partagas spices in it but nothing amazing like a D4 or P2. The thick creamy smoke coats the mouth. This is a good smoke so far but it lacks depth in flavours. Hopefully this will develop a little more. The flavors are straight to the point.The ash is dark gray, almost gun metal/PVD gray. It is soft and it detaches with a little help. Definitely not a long ash contest winner but who would compete with a cigar like that anyways.2nd third: This has stayed at medium body. The carrots turned into fruits, macerated dry fruits, very close to the prominent Ramon Allones flavor. This is getting a little better. It is straight to the point, spices, toasted bread and dry fruit. As if Partagas and Ramon Allones made a cheap and cheerful cigar. It shows off some faint tanginess, just like blackberries that are not quite ready to be eaten. I think I want this cigar to produce more flavor than it currently is.3rd third: This Panatela moved to light medium body. It is showing similar toasted spicy bread flavors with that faint dry fruit lingering. I would describe it as a toast with tangy jam if that made any sense. It sounds better than it actually tastes. The spices have gone down and body decreased to light now.It leaves a short finish on the tongue, a much dryer smoke than before. I would say this is a good way to finish this cigar. It is slowly dying, there is still an inch and a half to go but it is giving me taste signals to lay it to rest. Ten minutes after finishing this cigar, I still have a good Partagas taste that is reminding me of the cigar I just smoked and I like that.Value :  I would not necessarily go look intensively to find some but if a box surfaced at a low price, I would probably buy it for the \u201cmoochador\u201d.Overall Rating :  This is a quick afternoon cigar, something you don\u2019t have to sit down to enjoy and you feel no remorse if you have to toss it right after you lit it.

I had no construction issues with this cigar.  The ash remained firm with no flaking.", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/cohiba/cohiba-robusto-review", "full review": "Perhaps one of the more reviewed cigars has to be the Cohiba Robusto.  I find that smokers of this cigar either love it or hate it with no real in-between.  I for one don\u2019t like all my cigars to taste the same and look to different brands and varieties to keep my interest.  What good would only drinking your favorite bottle of wine be?  At some point the anticipation of enjoying that glass of wine or, in this case, that cigar would be lost.  This is why I ensure my humidor always has cigars with different flavor profiles and vitolas.  This particular sample came from a batch that was brought back to me from Cuba by a vacationing friend back in 2009.  With a box date of April 2009, this cigar is ready for smoking. Being one of my favorite robustos, I\u2019ve smoked many of these over the years.  For the purpose of this review though, I was sure to pay special attention to why this robusto has become a must have in my humidor.  Having been a fairly regular smoker of this cigar for the last 10 years or so, it has been my experience that this cigar does benefit from a little age and, at 3 years, becomes very smokeable.  Younger samples tend to be a tad bitter as you approach the center of the cigar and that bitterness lingers.  I find that a little age does it well in that regard.Appearance :  (4.75) The cigar sports the iconic COHIBA band with raised gold lettering and the label that we have always come to know as \u201cThe\u201d Cuban cigar. A perfectly applied triple cap tops this medium brown cigar. In my view, 2009 was the start of better constructed cigars out of Cuba.  The cigar has some give to it when lightly squeezed and as such I expect an effortless draw.  Deduction was for the veins that appeared quite thick and the sample I smoked had a water spot near the foot. Pre-light aroma was woodsy and earthy. The foot had a very pleasing natural tobacco aroma with hints of leather and cedar. Pre-light draw was easy and provided cedar and earthy tones.Construction :  I used a straight cut for this cigar as I do about 90% of the time. This cigar had the best burn of any cigar I've had in recent memory. It was perfect during the entire 55-60 minutes smoking time. No touch-ups were needed. It was a joy to smoke a cigar and never once need a touch-up. The draw was perfect as I had expected, with the cigar burning beautifully. The smoke remained cool. I had no construction issues with this cigar.  The ash remained firm with no flaking.Flavor :  (4.75) The first few draws greet you with a very peppery blast with hints of cedar and leather. Great white clouds of 'creamy' smoke. It screamed \"Cuba\" with that unmistakable Cuban aroma.  The first third provides flavors of cedar, leather with an earthy finish.  There are some cracked pepper notes on my palate with a long and pleasing finish.  The peppery hints lingered at the back of my tongue, never overpowering the well-balanced earthy notes.The pepper hints slowly subsided as I made my way through the first third; salty notes started to enter the flavor profile. By the end of the first third a pleasant saltiness remained on my lips with sweeter cocoa notes emerging. The hints of cracked pepper decreased but remained mildly present, subtle enough to be noticeable but light enough to let the flavors of the cigar shine through.I like cigars with thick smoke output and this one didn't disappoint in that regard. The smoke output remained thick and consistent. The burn was impeccable. The ash was grey/tanned white in appearance and held firm until almost the halfway mark. There was a beautiful layering in the ash's appearance indicative of exceptional construction.As I entered the second third of the cigar I started to pick up some sweeter notes with hints of dried fruit and toasted nuts. Some black cherry and slight citrus were picked up on my palate with the finish being sweeter and somewhat creamier.The second third offered a perfect balance of salt and sweetness underneath the primary woodsy, leathery and earthy notes. The hints of cracked pepper faded as I entered the final third. There was an ever so slight bitterness like that of dark chocolate near the halfway mark but this did not last long, quickly evolving into a pleasant espresso like flavor. Smoke output remained full and thick.For me, the final third is where this cigar shined, going to an entirely different level. The smoke was rich, oily and almost honey-like. Hints of black cherry, citrus and cocoa blended nicely with the primary cedar and leather notes of the cigar.These flavors remained perfectly balanced and at times it really felt like every puff was offering something different. Either I got the earthiness with a sweet finish or a sweet citrus and cocoa mouthful with an earthy/leathery finish. The complexity was very noticeable and kept my interest.If smoked slowly enough this cigar can surely be \"nubbed\" without any harsh bitterness and that is exactly what I did. I managed to nub this cigar, keeping my puffs regularly spaced near the end without getting any bitterness or heat that one gets by forcing a cigar longer than one should.  The band came off without effort.Value :  (4.25) There is often talk about how pricey Cohibas are and in fairness, unless purchasing them in Cuba where they still cost roughly $265.00 per box of 25 (I recently re-stocked 3 months ago in Cuba and managed to get an April 2011 box of 25 for $265.00) most people outside of Cuba will pay significantly more for this cigar.

If you can get this cigar for a reasonable price like $10.00 -$15.00 then, by all means, get a few.I am always rewarded with a perfectly complex, balanced and constructed cigar.  Now keep in mind I\u2019m basing the value rating of this cigar on the price I paid, which was the Cuban tag (which still makes it quite expensive, almost double the price of another top rated Cuban robusto, the Partagas Series D No. 4).  Had I rated a sample purchased here in Canada, my rating would have definitely been lower because the price associated with owning these cigars can be quite high.  I am convinced that many of the poorer ratings of this cigar are somehow connected to the hefty price tag attached them which is fair given that there are better things to spend one\u2019s money on than over-priced cigars.  However, finding a good source, asking travelling friends or visiting Cuba yourself as is easy and quite inexpensive for me, being Canadian, is what allows me to regularly stock up on these.  Not everyone has that luxury, which is understandable, but the price should not detract from the actual cigar experience when it comes to taste and overall flavor profile which I found to be, and have for the last 10 years that I have been smoking the Cohiba Robusto, consistent and pleasing.Overall Rating :  (4.75) Overall, the cigar was very complex, starting with a hit of cracked pepper over deep woodsy and earthy notes that evolved perfectly into cocoa, dried fruit, citrus and leathery notes with a subtle offering of cedar. The smoke output was full, rich and had a velvety texture to it. All of this was perfectly complimented by an ever so subtle salt on the lips.I am a fan of this vitola. The Hoyo de Monterrey Epicure No.2 and Partagas Series D No. 4's are unique and exceptional in their own way and are right up there with the Cohiba Robusto as my three preferred robustos. However where the Epicure is lighter in strength and is a somewhat sweeter cigar and the Partagas can often be a tighter packed cigar offering less woodsy notes, the Cohiba Robusto, at least in my view, has a perfect draw, is not as sweet or loosely rolled as the Hoyo and is not as firmly packed or peppery than the Partagas. It almost strikes a beautiful balance of the two. When I want sweet and light I reach for the Hoyo.  When I want peppery and strength I reach for the Partagas and when I want that woodsy medium to full body strength I reach for the Cohiba.", "flavor": " (4.75) The first few draws greet you with a very peppery blast with hints of cedar and leather.

Enjoy!Well, this is my first review ever on the internet. So I decided to smoke something special. I managed to get my hands on these beautiful Behikes and I\u2019d been planning to smoke one per year so that I can see how they age over time.  Let's see if this little robusto is worth the hype.Appearance :  It looks absolutely amazing. Loving that triple pigtail cap and light brown wrapper color. BHK52 feels a bit dry on the hand.  The texture reminds me of paper bags. I like to keep my cigars between 60\u00ad65 on the humidity scale. No visible veins.The foot has a very pleasing sweet tobacco aroma with hints of hay and cedar.

Burn was almost perfect through the whole cigar, a little wonky especially at second third, but otherwise never needed any attention or re\u00adlighting.Flavor :  From the beginning, that thick (almost foggy) smoke was flavored with grass and hay, signature flavors for Cohiba in my opinion. It left a slight espresso and leather taste on the back of my throat. These flavors continued until the final third. During the last third it started to get interesting. The hay and grass were almost gone, replaced by cocoa flavors featuring burnt espresso. I also observed some ammonia and bitterness towards the end. I have to remind myself that this was a young cigar. This is going to be great cigar for years to come as age helps the flavors to deepen and evolve. No doubt about that.Value :  Let's face it.

Upmann Magnum 48 was part of the 2009 Edicion Limitada series released every year by Habanos S.A. I had smoked one of these about a year ago and it kind of stuck to me. You know when you have a cigar that stays in your head for a while. Well, that was one of those. I only had two of these so I waited another year to smoke it. Now it\u2019s time to turn this one into another special moment.Appearance :  This is a gorgeous cigar. It has a dark, oily and soft wrapper. The wrapper seems to have some kind of goose bumps on it. This is a sexy stick.Construction :  It boasts the characteristics of a great Cuban puro. It has a firm touch, an expertly made triple cap and a full and tight foot. Top shelf build. The draw is easier than I would have liked but still good.Flavor :  At cold I am greeted with some crisp tobacco flavours which are very pleasant.1st third Right away I have some chocolate flavours with some cream: milk chocolate, not cocoa. It is sitting solidly at medium body. It is right on the money for me. It is showing some spices in the nose but very lightly. The finish is lingering and a little bitter but good nevertheless. This is a very nice first third.2nd third I can feel the nicotine building up in this one. This cigar is pretty consistent but it is showing long highlights of hay, cream and some overripe black cherry. They come and go slowly. These highlights are keeping me quite focused. The burn is straight and paced. There is no need to relight or touch up this one. The finish is getting longer as I smoke it.3rd third This is much stronger than I remembered. I don't think I would pick this as a first cigar of the day. It is pumping nicotine and the body is medium-medium full. The milk chocolate is gone and now I have some nice tobacco flavours mixed with some cooking spices, like the French proven\u00e7ale mix you buy in fine spices stores. This is original but I can't nub this one. It is giving me too much nicotine at this point.Value :  This is a good box to have in the humidor and pick one from time to time.

Here is his short bio:It all started on a trip to Cuba about 6-7 years ago when I walked in a Casa Del Habanos to buy a single stick to smoke. My, then, girlfriend was on a day trip for some sort of sailing activity. I was stunned to see the variety of sizes, brands and the smell that was opulent and vivid. I ended up spending the day in the smoking lounge in the back of the Casa smoking, trying different cigars, talking and drinking with the house 'torcedor' Mr. Alfonso. I was hooked. The following years I have found my way to online communities, herf organisation as well as taking a major part in my local cigar club, The Montreal Club. I have been back to Cuba almost every year since. My latest project is a Cuban cigars pairing blog, sticksanddrinks.tumblr.comHe starts off with a review of the discontinued Juan Lopez Corona.The Juan Lopez Corona is a pre-1960 release and has been discontinued since 2006. I picked this one up from a friend of a friend. The box code got lost in transit but it is of 2003. I have smoked a few Juan Lopez but I've got to say they are not a staple in my humidor. Hopefully, this one can change my mind and open up my humidor to a new marca.Appearance :  Visually, this cigar is good, not amazing but good. Wrapper is smooth looking, a little rough to the touch and is colorado coloured. I have to say I love old bands, this one definitely has that old Havana style to it which adds to the experience.Construction :  The Juan Lopez Corona seems well rolled, with good density and a nice foot. Once cut, the draw was pretty good, maybe a little on the tight side but barely. The triple cap seemed to have been put in a rush but what can you do, 1999-2004 are far from the best years for cigar production by Hsa [Habanos SA].Flavor :  Pre draw offers very little besides light tobacco flavours.1st third: Opens up softly, no big bang, quite an elegant start I must say. This sits at light to medium body. There is a light mixture of leather, citrus, almost that wet leather smell. Half way through the 1st third, the body picks up nicely and you can notice dashes of cinnamon, almost like brioches. If it made sense, I would say the flavour is light brown.The ash is a nice black and white marble, soft, detaches itself very easily. This is not the cigar to win the long ash competition at your next smoke meet.2nd third: We are back at light medium, it lost some momentum and I am left trying to define faint aromas. We are still in the world of leather but with some spices, green pepper; actually pink pepper (although it is not really a pepper per se). The burn needs frequent corrections and it alters the flavours. It adds a burned taste to everything in this cigar. This is definitely unpleasant.3rd third: I must say this is a bland cigar, too light for my taste. There are very little changes in the flavours. It provides nothing new or unseen before. I am guessing this is an example of a cigar that is good while young, with only a few years on it.The last part just picked up nicely and wow. I am impressed, medium body, spices, firewood, creamy spices, very nice. This is too little, too late in my opinion but if this represents a good example of this stick then I might have to search for another one.Value :  If you find these a bit younger, it might be worth buying one for the form if it is 7-8$ or less.

It totally fits my current needs - a short smoke with a reliable construction and enough punch to be suitable as an after-dinner cigar. For this reason, the 4-inches long Cuban puro made it to my top Cuban cigars of 2011 list.Appearance :  As you can see from the pictures, this cigar looks pretty impressive. The 50 ring gauge is the point where, for me, a cigar becomes too thick to smoke comfortably so I'm glad it's not a 52 or more. The wrapper, fairly rustic, might have a few water spots on some samples. Besides that, the Petit Robusto seems well-rolled and usually does not present any obvious visual defects.Construction :  The draw is usually spot on, I've had multiple boxes from different years and haven't had a single plugged cigar.

My 2010 box is ready to be smoked right now and there's some more room for progress. I've smoked 4 samples from the box for this review. Depending on the box date, it might start out tasting a little young with some hints of ammonia - there is almost none of this left on cigars from my box. The first third starts with a typical peppery Cuban blast, then quickly deploys cocoa and chocolate notes. Spice is present but far from overwhelming, allowing me to detect some more subtle flavors like nutmeg and almonds. The second third is more woody, with clear cedar flavors which become more intense as I approach the last third, medium+ in terms of power and exempt from bitterness of any kind. The finish is full of flavors and leaves you wanting to light another one.Value :  That's a pretty affordable Cuban and provides a good bang for your buck. If you have humidor space, getting a box for ageing is a good idea.Overall Rating :  A good 40-45 minutes smoke, the Hoyo de Monterrey Petit Robusto is one of my favorites in this format, along with the Montecristo Petit Edmundo which is slightly more imposing.

Check out his blog for more great reviews like this one!Tonight\u2019s Cigar is the Sancho Panza Escuderos, a special release for Germany as part of the Regional Edition series. The Sancho Panza brand doesn\u2019t get that much publicity, mainly due to the lack of different vitolas within the range and no real superstars within it either. You can argue that in many circles, the Sancho Panza Belicosos is known as a great insider\u2019s Cigar. However there\u2019s not enough people singing its praises to solidly give it that title on a wider scale.For that reason, it\u2019s great to see that 5th Avenue, the Cuban Cigar distributor in Germany have decided to release a Cigar under the Sancho Panza brand and under the Regional Edition Series.I\u2019ve always been skeptical regarding the whole Regional Edition series. Every year there are over twenty releases for a whole host of countries including Canada, the Middle East, Israel and Asia Pacific amongst others. Some of the releases are hit, but for most part, they just don\u2019t climb the heights I would expect Cuban Cigars of this price point. I\u2019ve had many Edicion Limitadas in the past that were a decent one off smoke, but I would not buy again. Would the Sancho Panza Escuderos be the same? There\u2019s only one way to find out...Online, there isn\u2019t really that much information regarding the Escuderos anywhere. Unlike the United Kingdom Regional Editions for example,      there\u2019s no fanfare, no launch, and therefore these somewhat get released under the radar. Because of this, I have no real comparison to anyone else\u2019s notes regarding this Cigar. Maybe it\u2019s a good thing. How many times you have read a review regarding a Cigar that you want to try; flavour x and y, however, when it comes to the time you smoke it yourself, those flavours and aromas described to you are not what you\u2019re detecting at that moment.Appearance :  This is one big Cigar. Measuring in at 6.1 inches by fifty ring gauge, the Sancho Panza Escuderos will no doubt command at least an hour and half smoking time.

However, this did not affect the enjoyment during the smoking of the Escuderos. Other than that, the burn was razor sharp. No issues whatsoever.Flavor :  On the first few draws, I was greeted with this spicy tingle, with an underlining sweet flavour that reminded me of caramel. The Escuderos smokes superbly - smooth, and planted firmly in the light to medium zone when it comes to strength. Towards the second third the spice had all but gone, however a raisin profile started to emerge that just complimented the caramel beautifully. The last third smoked as cool as the first and second thirds; a testament to the construction of the Cigar. The flavours didn\u2019t get that more intense; everything was well balanced.There was no real nicotine hit with the Escuderos, that is no doubt to do with the strength of the Cigar. I found myself at the end of the Cigar happy enough to get back to my business. I didn\u2019t have to sit down and endure any kind of nicotine hit. Because of this, along with the strength of the Cigar, I can find myself happily smoking this mid-afternoon, with a Beer, after lunch.From the first minute to the hour and twentieth minute, the flavours were solid and flavourful. Yes, I would have liked a little more complexity, but for such a young Cigar, I could not have asked for any more from the Sancho Panza. I\u2019m not sure how old this Cigar is, I would hazard a guess that it was made in March or April; so these are definitely smoke-able out of the box.Value :  A box of ten Sancho Panza Escuderos costs \u20ac148.00 euros online.

Currently I\u2019m supplied with Cohibas and other Cubans by an old family friend in Geneva who buys boxes at Casa del Habano and then walks to the post office down the street and mails them to me.  They are most assuredly not fake.  It is certainly true that one defining characteristic of Cohibas is that they have a clean, grassy note.  However, I\u2019ve never heard smoking them described, by anyone, ever, as like \u201cchewing on wet, bitter grass.\u201d  I think Suckling put it best when he said that the true defining characteristic of a Cohiba is that they leave your mouth feeling absolutely clean.

Happy reading!Cohiba is one of the cigar brands that need no introductions. The flagship brand of Habanos S.A. and the personal brand to Dictator Fidel Castro, Cohiba is the cream of the crop for Cuban cigars and you certainly pay top dollar for that.As the Robusto is my favorite cigar vitola, it should come as no surprise that the Cohiba Robusto would be a cigar I would be interested in. I have looked forward to having one for a very long time and opportunity came knocking. Here are my thoughts.I've read from a number of sites that construction issues plague Cohiba; complaints range from loosely rolled cigars to cracked wrappers. Fortunately the three Cohiba Robustos I sampled exhibited no problems, physically anyways.The Cohiba Robusto has very small, minor veins on it's otherwise ordinary looking milky chocolate wrapper. When squeezed, there is some slight sponginess, but no soft spots so no odd burning issues are anticipated. The burn is decent, I did touch it up a few times with my Zippo Blu. The ash is an unimpressive flaky salt-and-pepper color that refused to hold for more than an inch at a time.Pre-light draw revealed very subtle hints of...hay/grass...? The foot of the Cohiba Robusto smelled like nothing but perhaps the subtle scent of floral.The first third of the cigar is the worse in flavor. A combination of what I can only describe as chewing on wet, bitter grass. Of the two Cohiba Robusto I smoked, as well as my buddy who had one, that inital crap taste was consistent on all three. Yum.By the second third, things definitely started getting better. The bitterness resided and flavors of coffee as well as dark chocolate began to overtake.The last third is where this baby starts to shine and becomes what one would expect of a Cuban cigar. A touch of pleasant spiciness develops and becomes an enjoyable smoke.Despite all the talk about the strength, power, and kick of Cohiba cigars, I hate to say it but, it is overstated. The Cohiba Robusto, in my opinion, is more of a decent medium body cigar compared to, say, the Bolivar Royal Corona. But let me add, what I consider a strong cigar isn't one that necessarily is overpowering, kicks the crap out of you and churns your stomach like drinking heavy liquor on an empty stomach, but rather the quality and complexity of taste.At $15 a cigar, the Cohiba Robusto, to me anyways, is hardly a value buy. A box purchase of 25 will certainly set you back a pretty penny. Had this cigar been more enjoyable from the get-go, it would be worth having a few stickslying around in the humidor for those special occasions.Undoubtedly, I'm sure some readers may find my observations and experience with the Cohiba Robusto a bit harsh, but when a cigar passes the $10 mark, I'd expect to pay for more than just the brand name. Given the many Robusto choices, I have to say I'm more likely to reach for a Bolivar Royal Corona or a Montecristo Petit Edmundo for more half the price of a Cohiba Robusto. Obviously everyone's taste varies, but for my taste, despite how much I've been looking forward to having a Cohiba Robusto and finally having one, the experience came up short.I'm sure down the road, I may consider trying a couple or few more to be sure, but that won't be anytime soon.Appearance :  Construction :  Flavor :  Value :  Overall Rating : ", "flavor": " Value :  Overall Rating : ", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/cohiba-robusto-rb.jpg?iv=16"}, "por larranaga petit corona review": {"origin": "Origin : Cuba Format : Petit Corona (Mareva) Size : 129 x 16.67 mm (5 1/8 x 42) Ring : 42 Weight : 8.46 g Hand-Made Price : ~$300 for a cabinet of 50More info about purchasing Por Larranaga cigars...", "overall rating": " It is very important to determine the optimal aging time for the Por Larranaga Petit Coronas.

Well done.Flavor :  We all know that Cuban cigars might taste 'green' when they are young. Sometimes this fact or belief (to each his/her own) makes people forget about the objective quality of the cigar - isn't it easier to say \"it just needs age\" when a cigar doesn't taste as you'd expect it to? The problem is that in some cases age doesn't do much to enhance the cigar's flavor or it needs more years than an average aficionado is ready to wait. This being said, I'm fairly sure that this 'aging potential' can be detected at any stage. Two examples come to mind - the H. Upmann Royal Robusto that is a stellar cigar that's only going to get better and the Juan Lopez Benelux Regional Edition which doesn't seem to be able to progress anytime soon.After this long introduction (which represents my personal and humble opinion, your mileage may vary), I'd like to say that Ramon Allones Superiores has no less potential than the other LCDH-exclusive release I just mentioned. Furthermore, just like the Royal Robusto, it smokes damn good right now! The first third is rather delicate after the initial spice and is a bit short of medium-bodied; it brings coffee, cocoa and nuts flavors to the table. A great deal of complexity is added in the second third as all flavors become more intense and the pepper reappears. The body is medium and the smoke is very fresh and smooth. A bit of leather and hints of wood are added to the bouquet in the last third. Despite rare vegetable notes (hay?) that I did encounter throughout the whole smoking experience, I wouldn't say that the Superiores tastes young. It just tastes good, and it's going to get even better!Value :  To be honest with you I don't remember how much I paid for them, probably around 10 EUR per stick.

The after taste is very clean and short. There aren\u2019t any flavors left in mouth. The caramel flavors are really well defined. I am really enjoying this.2nd third The second part is very similar to the first one. It changes slightly and adds some toasted bread flavors. The sweet honey/caramel aroma is turning into a strong defined sweet cherry flavor. That\u2019s pretty unexpected but quite good. There is more smoke and still no aftertaste lingering in the mouth. Past the halfway point, I can feel the nicotine build up. The body is light-medium.3rd third The sweetness that I tasted on my lips is now leaving.

I must say that I was pretty disappointed when I found out that Cuban cigars there cost even more than in France (considering that a pack of cigarettes is 5 times cheaper). That's why I only smoked one Cuban cigar and that's the Montecristo No. 4. According to some sources, this is the most sold cigar in the world (I know for sure that this is the second best-selling cigar in France, behind the Partagas Serie D No. 4). It is considered as one of the big classics.Appearance :  Incredibly beautiful maduro wrapper, oily and silky. I liked how this one looked.Construction :  Although rumor has it that No. 4s sometimes are completely unsmokeable due to extremely tight draw, I am usually satisfied with the construction. The burn is always even, the only thing that in my opinion could be better is the amount of smoke. Check out the impressive ash on the picture below. \u00a0 Flavor :  A little earthy in the beginning, the Montecristo No. 4 delivered a lot of spice in the second third. Closer to the end, soft notes of cocoa and coffee appeared, which reminded me of the Montecristo No. 5. The difference is that... this one lasted longer! :)Value :  Rather good value. Monte No. 4 is less expensive than Cohiba Siglo II or Trinidad Reyes. However, there are other nice marevas that are even cheaper, such as Punch Petit Coronas.Overall Rating :  I can definitely see why it's one of the best-selling cigars in the world.

That being said I liked this choice but not my favourite maybe 4th of the 5 I got. Nice and firm to the touch. Had a few anxious moments with uneven burn I had to correct.

In the final third, the power kicks back in along with stronger flavors.  A coffee note emerges as the most prominent at this point.

Beginning in the mid 1980s, quality control became a concern to Davidoff.  In 1987, Zino Davidoff condemned Cuban craftsmanship on French television.  The rift between Zino and Cubatabaco escalated to the point where, in 1989, Zino publicly burned 130,000 of the Cuban-made Davidoff cigars that he had deemed of low quality and unfit to sell.  Officially, the Cuban Davidoff line was discontinued in 1991.This box was acquired new by my father, an infrequent cigar smoker, in the late 1980s.   He died about ten years later and, in remembrance, I have taken to smoking one of these (or one of a small handful of other cigars that were his) on the anniversary of his passing.  I think it has been three years since I last smoked one of these.  This year I was out of town on that date, so I am smoking this a bit late.

However, in the beginning of the second third, to my surprise, the flavors become almost sugary, but not sickly sweet - something close to sugarcane. I have also distinguished notes of dried fruits. I really did not expect this as it's not something I am used to find in Punch cigars, which are usually based around woody flavors. Anyway, the second third was quite pleasant, with its medium body.

Unfortunately, this review is based on only one specimen, so I cannot assert that they are all ready right now.After having smoked both UK regional releases for 2008, I would like to say that they are both very good cigars, different from regular offerings.

It was the Cohiba Selecci\u00f3n Reserva and it contained 30 cigars in an assortment of sizes including six robusto sized cigars. My sample was very generously given to me by Brother of the Leaf who happened to own a bar in Denmark.  I had always hoped to make it over there and check out his bar and smoke a cigar with him but as it happens we have lost touch and I am not sure where he is anymore.  I have been saving this very special cigar for a special occasion and I am happy to be finally putting it to flame in celebration of 5 years of blogging about my passion for fine hand made cigars.This Cohiba has a very classic looking wrapper like light brown leather.  It is adorned with a normal Cohiba band and a second black and gold band displaying the Reserva designation.  The draw is absolutely perfect.  I used Gordon Mott\u2019s  \u201cThree Match Technique\u201d to get the cigar lit.  Right from the very start this cigar is smooth and buttery.  There were creamy notes of vanilla and hint of citrus with a nice floral aroma.  It wasn\u2019t long before it started to change up.  The flavors became woody and leathery with a bit of spice and I started to get a bit of salt and pepper on the lips.  The aroma is still very floral.  Underneath it all is that classic Cuban earthiness and twang.  Half way through and this is already one of the most amazing cigars I have smoked.  There are flavors I can\u2019t even figure out how to identify.  As I made my way through the smoke the cigar kept changing.  There were flavors of coffee, nuts, vanilla, honey, fruit, leather, and more.   There were lots of that Cuban earthiness mixed in as well and the cigar went from sweet to spicy and back to sweet, the flavors always smooth and creamy on the palate.  The flavors were full and rich but never overpowering and it had only a mild nicotine punch.  The cigar was an absolute joy to smoke from start to finish.  I can\u2019t imagine a better choice of cigar to celebrate my blog's 5 Year Anniversary.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

It entails taking three Montecristo No 5s that have rested in a well controlled humidor for 3 & 8 months and comparing them to a new, just arrived 04/08 box.At 8 Months : This is a well rounded little cigar. Has a nice floral start but builds by the end of the first third to become a very intruiging little stick. Starts to exhibit wood (ie Oak & Cedar), Honey and floral undertones. By 2/3 the way in it has built into an upper medium bodied smoke that wants to let you know it's a Cuban. Not overpowering but definitely forceful. Burn & construction are very good. Slight linger of coffee on the palate.At 3 Months : A nice Perla. Has a lot of ability but seems to lack some finesse. Flavour bends between leather and wood. Aftertaste is very slightly vanilla & floral.The construction has a bit to be desired as I had to adjust numerous times. Never relit though. Short Finish.New Box : These smell fresh and young. The one that I smoked from this box before laying them down was a nice little cigar but it lacked the great Montecristo aroma & intrigue. It became bitter towards the end and needed a lot of attention to the burn. Still, this is a great tasting cigar for one so small and young.Overall Assesment : These are great cigars if you let them rest. I believe that you should let any cigar rest at least a month if you buy it online. From a reputable shop you should be ready to go in a week. There are exceptions though and of course ageing any good Cuban is well worth the time if you are patient enough. I struggle, like you all, to give them time!

Vegas Robaina is not a marca I particularly appreciate but I am more than ready to have my mind changed.Appearance :  This is a great looking cigar.

The wrapper is a nice dark milk chocolate brown and it has a nice sheen to it.Construction :  This cigar is very well constructed and let itself get cut easily. It has a nice tightly packed foot. The cap is impeccable an the head is perfect.My sample had an easy draw and scents of chocolate & good tobacco at cold. The construction on these is perfect.Flavor : 1st third This cigar started out with a blast of sweet flavors of chocolate and coffee. This is a medium/full body cigar with great amounts of thick smoke. You can almost chew it. I can taste hints of leather and light fruit acidity. Sitting to my left was Ajay Patel from La Casa Del Habanos in London and he mentioned that this cigar reminded him of the Vegas Robaina Maestro, the 2007 Edition Regional Espana. I never tasted this cigar but I totally trust his expert palate. Given that the Maestro is a highly regarded cigar, this meant I was in for a treat.2nd third Second third, I've got to say this cigar is not the typical Robaina flavor I am used to get. It now sits at medium body with the same sweetness but with a touch of cream and leather. This is excellent. This turned into a very enjoyable and tasty cigar. My smoking partner, Art, points out that this cigar is very tannic like a young wine. It leaves your mouth dry and makes your lips pucker. That is spot on.3rd third The bottom of the last third is starting to be a bit too harsh for me; it has picked up to a full body and has some fruit flavors which I am sure will develop nicely over time. One thing I noticed is that this cigar didn't have too much ammonia in the smoke that makes some fresh cigars so robust. It burned very nicely with a marble colored ash.Value :  I always find the regional editions are a bit pricy and only some of them are worthy of the price they command. I didn't smoke enough to say if they are box worthy but it is worth trying out.Overall Rating :  This is a good cigar. I think that with a few years, less than five, this cigar will turn into something very special.

It is a shame that many of these jewels have become forgotten and almost look down upon.(same goes for some  marevas and coronas) As you say these cigars need a certain thoughtfull smoking. The kind of sensation that the cigar smokes you and not vice versa. It certainly is a cool smoke. The creamy light coffee taste on the palate is unique, and the flavours are subtle and rich.

Enjoy!Standing in one of the LCDHs in Cuba I was uncertain if this was the right purchase for me. I had never tried a Montecristo No. 1 and lonsdales are not typically my first choice of cigar size. On top of that I had been having bad luck with other Montecristos during the trip. I was however intrigued by the idea of purchasing a box of cigars that had already been aged without any work on my part. I am not normally one to gamble but on that day I was feeling bold enough to make a leap of faith. Upon returning home and lighting up I was very happy with the outcome and thought a good review would be in order.Appearance :  Immediately when I opened the box I was impressed. The cigars were beautifully box pressed by age and a few even had slight curves in the shape. They looked as if each cigar matched exactly with the one beside and I really did not want to disturb them from the box. Each cigar has a rustic appearance.

The advantage of this though is the smoke remains cool and pleasant. These cigars feel a bit delicate so I try to maintain an extra level of caution when smoking them or moving them around in my humidor.Flavor :  The flavour of this cigar is what really blew me away. Right off the bat I was getting nice creamy cappuccino smoke. There were hints of cedar on the palate reminiscent of the traditional Montecristo style however this cigar was much more committed to the creamy coffee flavours. The date for this box is from 2008 making it a 3 and a half year old box. I believe these cigars are at their prime smoking time right now. The youthful desire of the tobacco has been tempered by aged creating a rich harmony of flavours; a welcomed improvement from some of the younger Montecristos I smoked while in Cuba. The finish is smooth with noticeable leather. At this stage I would consider this cigar medium bodied. This is a change from the full-bodied pungent Cubans I normally turn to; however this cigar is nice in a subtler way.Value :  If you can manage to get a box for a decent price like I did then it\u2019s a great bargain.

And I definitely found it; however, it took far too much work to achieve. I am enamored with its format. When quality execution is present it is an amazing experience. That being said, the performance of some of these examples was frankly sub-par for an Edicion Limitada. At one point I set one cigar down for no more than 3 min. Upon my return, I found it had extinguished itself requiring a relight. For an EL seeking to become its own star this is completely unacceptable, especially considering the price. Thankfully there are many other offerings from Habanos that completely outstrips and outperforms this particular cigar in all aspects. To that end I am only able to provide a \u201cTry\u201d recommendation. Sure some will say, well, you got a bad box. Perhaps this is true. But, this is, after all, an Edicion Limitada.

Upon light up, this cigar immediately warns you that it means business, and that it is definitely a full bodied cigar. It starts with a spicy bang as well as a very pleasant cuban twang which intensifies throughout the cigar. During the first third I detected, roasted nuts, herbs and coffee flavourings with a pleasant herbacious aftertaste. Well into the first third there was also a bit of white pepper and vanilla. By the second third the spices began to kick in more, but the smoke remained very smooth.

Today, the blends are completely different and it's impossible to find taste similarities between the two.

I am amazed at how clean, short and crisp the finish of this cigar is. It\u2019s like pulling the handbrake at 20 km/h, it stops as soon as you pull it. Also, the smell from this cigar has loads of spices but almost none in the smoke it produces. We are sitting at a medium light body. This seems right for this cigar but the body is fluctuating a bit from after each drag.2nd Third After adjusting a bit, this petit corona is giving me some nutmeg flavor while sitting at medium body. My girlfriend, Eve, shows up to see if I am enjoying my cigar, she proceeds to take a puff and she says it tastes like a biscotti. And it does. She is spot on. There is a lot of nicotine in this, I can feel it creeping up on me, and so I step back a bit. The end of the second third is kind of bland.3rd Third There is a light sweetness, cherries that are not constantly there but they come and go. The sweet tobacco is still present. The finish is short and very sharp like the expression stopping on a dime. I can\u2019t say the last part of this cigar has impressed me much, it is a bit bland. There is a lot of nicotine here as well. I can feel my tongue tingling from it. It is too hot to nub, time to put it to sleep.Value :  This is a pretty good cigar and it performed pretty well.

The Cubans make good little cigars that are often much more tasty than their fatter big brothers.The wrapper is a bit interesting; it is a little darker than your standard Havana wrapper.  This might indicate a rich little flavor bomb!The draw is very nice, much easier than the Sancho Panza Molinas I had earlier.It took light nicely and unloaded a rich black coffee and a musky earthiness on me from the first puff.The burn was dead even and it delivered consistent voluminous plumes of smoke.Don\u2019t forget folks that the Diplomaticos line is basically an inexpensive Montecristo as the blends are almost identical.My only complaint is that because it is so short, my fingers started burning a lot quicker!", "flavor": " The aroma at cold has a minty flavor to it.", "image": "http://cdn.cigarinspector.com/wp-content/uploads/diplomaticos-no-5.jpg?iv=16"}, "hoyo de monterrey le hoyo du roi review": {"origin": "N/A", "overall rating": "N/A", "brand": "hoyo de monterrey", "appearance": "N/A", "value": "N/A", "reviews": "N/A", "construction": "N/A", "link": "http://www.cigarinspector.com/hoyo-de-monterrey/hoyo-de-monterrey-le-hoyo-du-roi-review", "full review": "This cigar has a classic Cuban appearance and comes in a traditional presentation. Unbanded in a cedar cabinet of 25 cigars, the wrapper is light brown and silky looking with a few puckered veins running across its surface. It has a triple cap and once I clipped it I could see an expertly done bunching of the tobacco that mirrored what I saw in the foot. I was concerned that the draw might be a little tight and I was right but it was still manageable. I have found many of the Cuban cigars I have smoked to be  excellent smokes, but only after they have been aged properly do they begin to truly shine. With eight and a half years under its belt this cigar demonstrated why many cigar lovers consider Cuban cigars to be the best in the world.The Le Hoyo du Roi starts off smooth and creamy with pronounced flavors of cafe au lait and wood. There are hints of black pepper and that Cuban earthiness that we all crave from a Habano. The pepper notes are subtle. It\u2019s like the cigar wants you to know its there but it doesn\u2019t want to overwhelm your palate, allowing you to enjoy all the subtitles it has to offer. The aroma is rich and decadent and the flavors have a chewiness to them that is simply fantastic. The smoke started off almost mild but continued to pickup as I progressed becoming a medium to almost full bodied smoke. It developed more spice but maintained its creamy/chewy characteristics. There were several flavors I picked up along the way that I couldn\u2019t identify, subtle notes that weaved in and out making for an engaging and very enjoyable smoke. I am convinced that smoking a Habano while it\u2019s young is such a waste. I have had the pleasure of a few aged Habanos over the years and they are always amazing smoking experiences and this cigar was no exception. The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the draw was just a bit too tight. I wish it were a bit looser making it a bit easier to smoke. The draw made me work a bit harder than I want to. I think that this was due to the fact that the cigar seemed over humidified.   It was too wet, so I hope some time in my cabinet at 62% to 65% RH will help the draw issue.This du Roi was very reminiscent of a 1999 Hoyo du Prince I smoked last year which I\u2019d rank as one of the best cigars I ever smoked. The 2000 du Roi ranks pretty high on my list as well now. Everything about this cigar, except the draw, was perfect and the flavors were out of this world.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever.

This cigar was part of a 5 variety sampler from C-C that also contained a Bolivar-Belicosos Finos.  Although both are presumably similar tobaccos (is this correct?) the Royal strikes me as a fully smoke.  Perhaps just the larger ring creates this flavor?  Excellent to my taste.

It isn't something I would want to smoke often, but I found it to be a very enjoyable change of pace.  I just wish I didn't have to wait so long to really enjoy one.  Perhaps this has changed with recent production... don't know.  The one thing I found myself wishing for with this cigar is more of a creaminess to the smoke.  It shouldn't have been as rough around the edges.  Regardless, it was an interesting and complex cigar that I recommend for a try.  Defintely sample some singles before a box purchase, as these aren't for everybody.This post was written by Jason.

It has gotten smoother since its youth, but I definitely expected better considering  it now has over 4 years of box age.  This core of flavors continued on into the second half where the grassy flavor morphed into a subtle orange/citrus flavor.  This is what turned me off to this cigar when young and it is much more delicate now.  Overall, I found this cigar to have a nice understated complexity.

I don't really know whether I love this marketing stunt by Habanos SA. On one hand, it allows me to try out a new cigar (and share my experience with you!) and - who knows - to be completely astonished by its quality. On the other hand, sometimes there's nothing special about a regional release. So far, it's fifty-fifty - some are top quality smokes, like the Bolivar Simones or Ramon Allones Eminencia whereas others are overpriced and almost disappointing. So it was with mixed feelings that I approached this French regional edition, El Rey del Mundo Petit Compania (is this the right spelling? Cupania?

However, about a third in, the peppery spice picked up a little and left a wonderful aftertaste on the back of the throat. At times, it was accompanied with a sugary sweetness. Around this point (about halfway in), the smoke turned to a nice display of roasted nuts and ended with the rich, earthy tobacco flavor profile that appears singular to the Bolivar line of smokes.I thoroughly enjoyed this cigar, especially the latter portions. That rich Bolivar flavor is addictive to me and I find myself in awe after each pull. I deducted half a point only because this cigar is far from reaching its potential, as it is still very young. At some points, I detected some slight tannic tastes to confirm this.  Regardless, it is full of delicious flavor.Value :  At $20 a stick, as much as it pains me to say, this cigar is overpriced.

It\u2019s a real salt of the earth cigar and when I\u2019m smoking it I feel like I could be out working the fields, cultivating the land or something else hearty like that. It should probably be noted that these are things that I am definitely not capable of doing but it is a nice to sort of feel like you could. At about halfway in, the cigar gives some powdered cocoa flavour. Past that there is no real evolution of flavour. They are fairly 1-dimensional and if you are really paying attention you may pick up some light floral notes on the finish. Medium bodied, they are not the most flavourful but it should be expected that these cigars will not make the occasion. Instead they help contribute to the experience by adding the familiar flavours reminiscent of long days and nights.

Milder than most Cuban cigars it is still full of refined, complex flavors and they are a joy to smoke. The hallmark of the Fonseca is the white tissue paper wrapper that graces every stick in the marca, and the bold portrait of Francisco E.

Right off the bat it delivers smooth flavors of nuts and cream with a subtle saltiness. It is absolutely sublime. It produces thick clouds of creamy white smoke and rich almost nutty aroma. The finish lingers pleasantly with a salty spiciness that is unlike any other cigar I\u2019ve smoked. As the smoke progresses the flavors begin to change. The predominate flavor is coffee and cream with a faint sweetness and occasional floral undertones. The construction on these cigars is flawless. With more than half the box smoked, I have never had a single issue of any kind with these cigars. The burn is razor sharp and the ash is perfectly formed and holds firm. I smoke these to the nub and almost burned my fingers as I finished this one up. It pained me more than the heat to put this cigar down.This post was written by Matt, one of the first cigar bloggers ever. Click here for more articles by Matt and more information.

Its factory name is Hermosos No. 3 which corresponds to a 5.5 x 48 size.Pre-light:  Slightly earthy smell, well-packed but pliant, excellent draw through the largest of my Victorinox Cigar Penknife hole punches.  Fresh \"green\" taste; tobacco, moss, grass.1/3: Very mild (hence ideal following a light meal or earlier in the day).  Slight spiciness (fruit cake) mingled with chocolate, very cool.  Excellent & even burn with a nice ash stack formation.2/3: The cigar warms up pleasantly releasing stronger chocolate flavours together with milky coffee (continuing the mild theme) and also some woody hints (as if from a log fire) - possibly oak.  Ash holds to a good 2\", keeping straight with a superb even burn.  Wrapper stays perfectly intact and the draw remains pleasant and \"warm\".3/3: A slight bite becomes evident during the last phase; white pepper and dark chocolate mingle with a stronger burnt wood taste, but the smoke remains velvety and can safely be passed round the sinuses to deliver the full flavour.Bolivar Super Coronas is an overall mild to medium bodied cigar with clear but uncomplicated flavours.  Coffee or a light drink complement it well and it can be enjoyed at lunchtime, despite its size (mine took around 90 minutes).

The pre draw shows a lot of cocoa aroma.1st third: Punch Special Selection No. 1 started with a bang, medium to full body right away. I did not expect that at all, with this cigar. There are some light spices, a little bit of wood. It feels as if the foot were full of something else because after just a few puffs the cigar settles at medium body. You can now taste the sweetness I had at the pre draw. Great chocolate flavours are all over the place. There is a buttery taste as well. This is a smooth smoke, a little dustiness maybe but nothing to make this a bad experience. I am really enjoying it.2nd third: This cigar keeps on giving a velvety sweet tobacco taste with notes of cocoa. It is steady at medium body. There is some acidity that shows up in the back, almost like a fresh Montecristo \u2018twang\u2019. This cigar has five years on it, so I doubt it is because it lacks aging. It is moving a little on the toasted side. The dustiness has left completely; this is turning out to be a great cigar. The burn is starting to require a little correction here and there. This is not a problem as this cigar is giving me lashes of creamy cocoa/chocolate flavour.  Wow, I am impressed so far.3rd third: After two good thirds, it is now giving me some bitterness, I hope it is not dying on me. I suspect the burning issues are responsible. I let it go out and go for a fresh relight. Ok, we are back in business. Toasty tobacco and the \u2018twang\u2019 are welcoming me back to this stick. Chocolate/cocoa has gone but I still get the creamy butter feeling. This is keeping at medium body and is showing some great toasted flavours again. I am nubbing this cigar.

Hard to say at this point, since the Petit might gain in popularity, which would mean increased demand and (perhaps) less quality control.I might add that the size and shape of the cigar also make for pleasant smoking.  It sits in my hand like it was made for it (which it was, but not all cigars are this perfect).Flavor :  On pre-light, I detect a simple aroma of tobacco with a hint of hay.  The flavors during the first third definitely follow suit.  I get most tobacco with a hint of toasted nuts and chocolate.  The chocolate note is sweet, not bitter, like milk chocolate, though it is faint and hangs around only in the backdrop, rounding out the other notes.  The cigar is producing plenty of aromatic smoke.The second third is much like the first, with notes of tobacco, toasted notes, and now a hint of wood.  There\u2019s also briefly a sour note that I can\u2019t quite identify, but is similar to the sour note found in the Montecristo Petit Edmundo (also part of the current lineup).  In the final third, the wood becomes more prominent, enhanced by what I am now certain is a combination of chocolate and coffee.  The subtle sweetness makes for a delightful aftertaste on the palate.  There isn\u2019t a single bitter moment, even at the end, and I can smoke this cigar happily down to the nub.Overall Rating :  (4.25) The price is quite an obstruction when it comes to buying the Montecristo Petit No. 2, and certainly when it comes to enjoying them with any sort of regularity.

The construction is as good as it gets, and the flavors are wonderful.  Also try out the Petit Edmundo if you\u2019re looking for another \u201cpetite\u201d cigar in the same price range.  It has darker, bitterer flavors, but both are very well balanced and excellent additions to your humidor.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Enjoy!The Ramon Allones Gran Robusto Exclusivo Benelux (yes that\u2019s a mouthful) is a Robusto Extra Vitola originally released in 2007 in a rather exclusive quantity. Six hundred numbered boxes containing 25 cigars and 204 numbered cabinets containing 50 cigars for a total of 25,200 cigars were made available for the Benelux market. These first samples proved to be such a success that Ramon Allones decided to repeat the feat by re-releasing the cigar in 2008 on rather generous terms: 1,400 boxes of 25 and 600 Cabinets of 50 cigars (65,000 cigars in 2008) flooded the market. A lot of the cigars are still out there and a trip to my regular cigar supplier (Le Roi Du Cigare, Koningstraat 25, 1000 Brussels) proved ample supply. Not that its availability detracts from its appeal, but let\u2019s say that I\u2019m a sucker for everything exclusive. After purchase these cigars have been sitting another 6 months in my humidor at 72% humidity.Appearance :  With a 50 ring gauge this cigar is surely in line with current market trends though its 155mm (6.1 in) length makes sure it still looks refined and elegant. The wrapper has a nice light brown color which has become almost matte due to the residue of essential oils, obviously a result of the aging process that these cigars have undergone prior to release. Nevertheless the cigar still carries that light oily sheen I like to see on my wrappers. The samples I\u2019ve tasted (I smoked 4 over the past months) all came from different boxes of the 2008 release and thus might have different taste notes from the cabinet version I still have to get my hands on. The cap is well executed and clipped away perfectly with my Xikar double guillotine cutter.Construction :  There was a big difference in construction between the cigars I had, with some of them showing very poor construction up to the point where you believe it will create some serious issues during smoking. All the cigars have one protrusive vein that seems to compress the cigar near the middle. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have a picture of the cigar where this was so extreme the cigar actually curved inwards. The cigar I used for the review pictures was the best one of all 4 and actually the replacement I received upon return of the former (draw was so tight that there was no pleasure in smoking). Apart from the one vein, the construction of these cigars is OK but never exceptional.On the picture below you can see the \"bumpiness\" of the vein, almost trying to pull the wrapper into the cigar.As with the quality of construction, the draw on these cigars also varied heavily, from almost completely stuck, too tight, to absolutely perfect. Since the cigars came from different boxes we can assume that it\u2019s not a problem related to one roller or a certain batch, so watch out when you buy these online for instance, you could have a bad surprise. But on the last one I smoked the draw was as perfect as it gets for me. Open with just that little bit of resistance that makes you draw the smoke in your mouth just a little longer than usual, just for fun, giving out tons of silky smoke. Almost heavy enough to bite, but ever so subtle and light. Because of my previous experience with this cigar, I rolled it in my hands prior to smoking so this might have helped with the draw; in any case it was very, very good. The burn was good and didn\u2019t need any touching up during the whole smoke. The ash is a mix between very light and darker grey layers that holds on very well.Flavor :  Now this is where this cigar shines, and probably why people were so fond of it RA had to release these to the market again. Pre-light, this cigar has the typical Cuban manure scent to it assisted by some white pepper, undertone of vanilla and a lingering sweetness, something of a light caramel in the pre-draw.After toasting the foot the first puffs give way to hay and grass, tastes that I wouldn\u2019t necessarily link to a cigar of this age. After the first cm though nothing of its young profile remains and the cigar turns to more bitterness, always with a sweet touch, the light caramel from the pre-light has turned darker brown. From this point you get a little more pepper lingering on the lips and a lot of salt, not your everyday kitchen salt but good authentic sea salt such as you might find in gastronomic butter, just lovely. I was enjoying a lovely Brunello 2004 with this cigar which really helped to bring out the floral notes and fruitiness that hide a little bit deeper in this cigar\u2019s light bodied flavor profile.This is not a cigar that overwhelms you with power or taste; it\u2019s very complex, elegant, and rather light. It would do very well together with nice full bodied champagne (preferably 100% pinot noir). For instance, when celebrating new years in the South of France after having just acquired a cabinet as a self-given Christmas present. In this regard the pairing with the Brunello was maybe not the best option: although its age had given the wine more roundness and length it was a little bit overpowering to the cigar at some points.But I digress, back to the cigar shall we! At the end of the first third the cigar kept on giving out nice clouds of smoke with increasing amounts of pepper and first hints of walnuts.This nutty experience continues in the second third and is joined by its friends leather and wood, always supported by the more fruity and floral notes. I would say that the cigar has gone from a light to a light medium body profile. One of the things this cigar does so well is to throw flavors at you that you don\u2019t expect, which disappear again moments later and keep you pondering later on. It\u2019s like behind the curtain of a quite consistent though very enjoyable flavor profile you also get a very playful and entertaining cigar that leaves a lasting impression. By the end of the second third the floral notes are becoming more prominent.In the last third the bitterness increased again and we can now speak of a medium bodied cigar. This bitterness accompanied by leather as before is never intrusive or unpleasant in any way as it\u2019s always accompanied by an almost unidentifiable sweetness that reminds one of dark chocolate and caramel. The cigar stays soft and smooth until the end, a real masterpiece of flavor and complexity.Value :  At 13,50EUR/piece I consider this cigar to be good value. The experience you get tastewise is very enjoyable. It took me a little bit more than an hour to smoke this cigar and I enjoyed every minute of it! I will certainly buy this one again.Overall Rating :  This cigar is a very special and complex cigar in every way.

Juan Lopez Obus was released in 2007 and the Ramon Allones Especial a year later, in 2008. I decided to do a comparative review of these rare smokes because I clearly found that one is superior to the other.Appearance: Ramon Allones WINS As you can see, both cigars look quite attractive. However, the wrapper on the Ramon Allones is definitely oilier and the pre-light smell is much more intense.Construction: TIE I found both cigars to be superbly constructed, it was a real pleasure handling those beauties. This is what I expect from a limited edition, unfortunately the rule is not always respected.Flavor: Ramon Allones WINS The Juan Lopez Obus is elegant, with dominant woody and vegetal flavors. It is a medium-bodied cigar and it leaves one wanting more complexity. Just what the Ramon Allones provides... it starts out with a pleasant spice kick and quickly deploys roasted coffee and cedary flavors. The time has already done much good to the cigar as it does not taste 'green', it is in fact quite balanced despite being powerful.Overall: Ramon Allones WINS 2 euros more expensive, the Ramon Allones is still the better choice between the two. Juan Lopez Obus is a quality cigar, but it doesn't stand a chance compared to the RA.This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Here's more about this special smoke: Habanos Press release. I couldn't pass up the opportunity to smoke a cigar of this magnitude, even at nearly a dollar per millimeter of tobacco.As I take it out of my trunk humidor, I can't help but notice how unassuming it is.  The wrapper looks like any other Habano, light brown and thin with very little visible veins - just a little more red in color.  I expected it to be heftier than it is: most Cohibas are packed very tightly, but not this one.  Upon clipping it, I notice the pre-light draw is very easy - different from most Sig VI's.I toast the foot and begin to draw in the best that Cuba has to offer.The first few puffs are milder than I expected, even given the tobacco's age.  The flavors are slighlty woody with leather and white pepper that still manages to tickle the sinuses.To say that this cigar is complex is almost a disservice, every puff yields a different note all the while maintaining a perfect balance and a long finish.The pepper note picks up a bit an inch in paired with that wonderful earthy mustiness that makes Cuban tobacco so unique.The burn is dead even and the aroma of the smoke is floral and intense!Another inch in, the cigar gets richer and stronger, notes of espresso and anise abound.Notes of tea are paired with the leather and wood with a hint of cocoa powder on the finish.  There is also a surprising amount of mint present.Halfway through, if you can believe this, the Siglo 6 Gran Reserva gets better.  The retrohale is musty and rich and is better than anything I have ever smoked.  The cocoa notes intensify and accentuate the licoricy finish.As this cigar draws to a close I can only think of something I often hear from the cigar community, that Cubans aren't all they're cracked up to be, and that they've dropped off in the last decade or so.  Really?  I'd put the best of Cuba against what anyone in any other country could produce any day.  This is simply the best cigar I have ever smoked.  Really my only complaint is that this cigar smokes too fast, I would compromise the draw to make this cigar last longer!Rating: 105 (A++)This post was initially published at Zen & The Art of the Cigar, a cigar reviews blog.

I fell in love with the format (it's a shorter and thinner torpedo, basically) at first sight. Then bad reviews started pouring in and I also personally contributed by describing how the Montecristo Open Master didn't live up to my expectations. I was so disappointed that I called this blend \"disappointment of the year\" in my recent list of the best Cuban cigars of 2009.However, I kept some Regatas in the humidor in order to revisit the blend a couple of month after its release and give it a second chance. This is precisely what I did this week. I took it out of the humidor and a quick inspection indicated that there were no visible flaws to the cigar. On the contrary, it looked quite good with its nice shiny wrapper and the double band. The smell was typical Cuban (sweet & sour), just like one would expect a Monte to smell like. So, it made me almost forget my bad experience with the Master and I was looking forward to a pleasant smoke. I clipped the cap and discovered a spicy pre-draw, which didn't surprise me much.When I was done toasting the foot and took the first pulls, an aggressive spicy taste took over my palate. The smoke, not abundant at all, was dry and not exactly pleasing. As soon as the initial spice dissipated, plain woody flavors made their way in and I immediately recognized them... Open. Sighing loudly, I continued to smoke, wishing for a sudden change of pace but it never occurred. I quickly got bored with the cigar which, I must admit, was well-constructed. In order to salve my conscience, I lit another one the next day and it resulted in a pretty similar experience.My conclusion is that, unfortunately, Montecristo Open defended its title of the \"disappointment of the year\".This post was written by Denis aka Inspector, who founded CigarInspector.com back in 2007.

Check out the shop for a nice selection of Cubans.Fonseca is a discreet Cuban brand that only has four sizes in the current production. I haven't had a chance to try many of their offerings, I just remember being unimpressed with their smaller cigar, the KDT Cadetes that I bought a fiver of two years ago.

The cigar produced nice amounts of white thick smoke.Flavor :  There's a decent amount of spice in the first third, with a solid woody background. The smoke is rather round and creamy, pleasantly caressing the palate. Medium-bodied from the beginning, the cigar slowly deploys its flavors, which are basic yet enjoyable. Again, there's wood, a hint of spice that is present throughout the smoke after an initial burst, roasted coffee here and there. The flavors remain consistent until the end while the strength of the cigar increases a little.Value :  Unlike a lot of regional editions, these Fonsecas do not command a $15+ price tag.

I also picked up some tea characteristics once or twice and also a cafe con leche once in a while.I can go on and on about the aroma, but I won't. Simply put, it smelled like the best-baked cake just came out of the oven and you walked in to the kitchen and the cloud of aroma was all up in your face. The smoke is mellow, smooth and the draw was just right. It burned great and the ash was fun too.This cigar was simply amazing. And honestly, it reminded me of the Vegas Robaina 5th Aniversario. However, this cigar was definitely better. Why? Because the VR was a little too light at times, but this cigar was perfect with a ton of body, but still remained smooth and fresh on your palate.I hope I don\u2019t get a lot of emails for this score, but I have to score it how it is and keep it real with you guys. At this moment, the aroma, the burn, the mellowness, the flavors, the appearance, the aged Cuban tobacco taste we all love, the size of the cigar, the sun shining on my yorkie Posh aka Agent 4 Pounds, and just how perfect everything is going. This is the score.Rating: 99This post was written by The Cigar Spy, a team of special cigar agents. Click here for their latest articles and more information.

Even though I'm not a fan of the Romeo y Julieta brand, I had high expectations for this petit torpedo, mostly because of its age. 7 years (at least, because limited edition leaves are supposed to be aged prior to the release) seemed sufficient to me for the cigar to start shining, so I didn't wait long before firing one up.

We've reviewed some of the cigars from the series previously: Le Hoyo du Roi and Le Hoyo des Dieux. Le Hoyo series was initially designed to offer a richer, more full-bodied smoking experience, but I'm not sure there's still a significant body difference with other cigars within the brand.

At approximately $3 each (online), the price/quality ratio is particularly interesting. Quintero Londres Extra are usually well-constructed, with a self-correcting burn, easy draw and ample smoke. The flavor is bold (wood, leather) and consistent from start to finish, I would classify this as a medium- to full-bodied smoke.

What have we got here? A Montecristo Grand Edmundo (5.9 x 52), a Partagas Serie D Especial (5.6 x 50) and a Trinidad Short Robusto T (4 x 50). Notice the ring gauges... The Monte sounds plain boring, Partagas is not really a favorite brand of mine, so the choice of the first cigar to test was fairly quick - Trinidad Robusto T was my favorite cigar in 2009 and I couldn't help thinking that there would be other similarities between these two besides the name.Appearance :  The Short Robusto T has a rustic (which is typical of Trinidad) dark brown wrapper with a fair bit of imperfections (a couple of water spots, a trace of glue). The cigar is quite bumpy. However, the pigtail and the triple cap look great.Construction :  The construction is spot on, with a draw that has the perfect amount of resistance and a burn that behaved very well in a windy environment (I did need to apply a couple of corrections).Flavor :  Pre-light, the cigar has that sour smell that we all like. It is especially strong at the head, while the foot has a distinct woody smell. The wrapper is very spicy. As soon as I'm done toasting the foot, I experience the first bouquet of the Short Robusto T - it is composed of sweet coffee, wood and pepper. What's striking is that the flavors change from puff to puff - the sweetness becomes more or less present, from time to time I discern some (rare) toasted notes and the spiciness seems to randomly fluctuate. Very complex and medium-bodied. As I enter the second third, the addition of bitterness is obvious, it starts to taste like dark chocolate. Pretty enjoyable as well. In the last third, the sweetness and the pepper disappear, resulting in a heavy, mostly woody finish.Value :  This is where a comparison with the Trinidad Robusto T is inevitable.

Upmann cigars...Now that the warmer weather is melting away the snow, I have had the chance to smoke the last of three sticks I wanted to have before writing this review. Without risking frostbite of course.  The H. Upmann Noellas were discontinued some time in the 1980s, but at one point were regular production cigars. They were sold in beautifully presented glass jars of 25. In 2009 they were re-released as a LCDH Exclusivo. I have read they were not actually available until 2010 and some places didn't see them until 2013. I am not sure when they were released in Canada, I just know I purchased mine at the LCDH Toronto in May of 2014.I am a big fan of the H. Upmann marca. I can't say I have smoked every stick in the line-up, but I have yet to have one that was not to my liking. One of the first Cubans I ever smoked was an H. Upmann Corona Junior.  Although it is a bit pedestrian as far as Cubans go, it was with this that I realized what all the fuss was about with cigars. So let's see how the Noellas stacked up for me.Appearance :  These sticks all had beautiful milk chocolate wrappers with a slight sheen to them. All appeared to be very well rolled and with the exception of one of the sticks, the caps were well applied. There were some thin veins running through the wrappers, but this really doesn't bother me as it is a leaf after all.

However once things got rolling the draw opened and with a little work they did end up producing a good amount of smoke. As mentioned earlier, one of the caps was a little off, but this really is irrelevant because they all held up just fine to a double guillotine cut. The burn on these was spot on and in general these are beautifully constructed. Exactly what you should expect to get from a LCDH Exclusivo.Flavor :  The initial impressions were that this is a mild strength cigar with a medium body. There is that familiar saltiness when I taste my lips post draw. The front end flavor is cream and as it progresses I detect a pleasant sweet note that blends well with the initial creaminess. The sweetness is faint and leaves me wanting more. There is also a slight pepper note on the finish. Near the end of this third is when the draw opens up and the stick really starts producing a good amount of smoke.In the second third the cream is still present and the sweet note from earlier is now accompanied by some baking spices and a little cedar. When all combined I swore it tasted like gingerbread sometimes on the retrohale, but maybe I am reaching. The finish remained peppery and it seemed to build as I neared closer to the final third. In one of the smokes I detected a weird herbal note in this third that was kind of like rosemary. It caught me off guard, but was not consistent with the other sticks I smoked. Worth a mention though.In the final third the strength settles in at about medium. I had to take it easy on the retrohale as it became a little strong for my experience. The creamy sweetness seemed almost nonexistent here, while the cedar and pepper competed for dominance.  These flavors continue to where the smoke threatens to get hot, which is when I usually leave a cigar to self extinguish.Value :  I bought the sticks for this review as singles for around $20 each.

I have already tried the Belicosos and the Coronas, but the Molinas is a new size for me.I like Sancho Panzas, I just don\u2019t love them.  This one for me starts out nice enough: salty and nutty with some coffee notes.The draw is very tight in this heavily box-pressed cigar.  They put a LOT of tobacco in this skinny fellah.  It is a light brown tawny colored cigar with few visible veins and very firm to the touch.There is a subtle vegetal quality that is why I don\u2019t go ga-ga over SPs.I am enjoying this cigar with a hot mug of Larry\u2019s Beans Mountain Sumatra and it is pairing perfectly with this cigar.This cigar did require a lot of attention.  I could not put it down for a minute without having to relight it.

The last sample needed to be relit twice and needed a lot of effort to stay lit in between.Flavor :  Overall I would classify the El Rey Del Mundo Choix Supreme as a very mild cigar.  Feel free to smoke it in the morning and on an empty stomach.  It was so mild in fact that there were instances where I was so desperate to taste something that I wanted to inhale it as I smoked it.  I purposely exhaled out of my sinuses and nose in order to capture some much needed spice from this smoke.  While present, the underlying pepper tones were very muted.As for flavour, the cigar started with hints of honey roasted nuts and some very subtle white pepper nuances.  As the cigar progressed I started to get some sweeter hints best described as caramel-like with some hints of cocoa.  I got very little hints of salt on my lips and again, very subtle peppery nuances.  As mentioned, I was really struggling to get any mouthfuls of smoke.  The finish was very short and I found myself needing to take frequent puffs in order to continue to capture any flavour.From about the second third onwards I noted some increased sweetness that is best described as honey-sweetened coffee.  Some earthiness was present as was a little more pepper and spice than compared to the first third of the cigar. Generally though, the cigar remained on the sweeter side.I found myself putting the cigar to rest earlier than I normally do with all 3 samples.  My samples simply required too much effort for too little reward. As I said, I really wanted to enjoy this cigar and the looks of the cigar certainly gave me high expectations.  However, the overall flavour and effort required to obtain those flavours were simply disappointing. I would classify this cigar as light in both strength and body.  There were enough discernable flavour changes to keep me from labelling this cigar as one-dimensional but there simply wasn\u2019t enough flavour to make me want to come back for more.I am of the belief that a little age helps an already tasty and good cigar but aging doesn\u2019t improve a cigar that is lacking to begin with so I really don\u2019t expect to get any different results from the remaining two if I decide to come back to them in a couple of years.Value :  These can be had for $10.00 and certainly much cheaper on the Island.   The ones I had were purchased in 2010 for $10.25 each.  It is hard to rate value high considering I wouldn\u2019t pay any money for any more of these cigars.  However, the price is a bit high considering the fact that the cigar is smaller than most robustos and, in my opinion, the fact it was so mild really makes it hard to find any value in this cigar at all. For my money I would rather turn to the Vegas Robaina Famosos which in my opinion is a far superior cigar.Overall Rating :  I was truly disappointed with this cigar and I failed to see or taste what many others had tasted.  It is possible that I simply got a bad bunch however I have not read about many construction or production issues that affected the Choix Supreme.  As I stated, the appearance of the cigar was flawless and It looked like it would smoke well.  However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just a bad fluke after experiencing 3 very similar and equally disappointing smokes.  The sheer beauty and flawless even burn on this cigar is what kept this cigar at 3 out of 5 stars.  Had the rating been on taste alone, It would have been 2.5.", "flavor": " Overall I would classify the El Rey Del Mundo Choix Supreme as a very mild cigar.  Feel free to smoke it in the morning and on an empty stomach.  It was so mild in fact that there were instances where I was so desperate to taste something that I wanted to inhale it as I smoked it.  I purposely exhaled out of my sinuses and nose in order to capture some much needed spice from this smoke.

I like me a good powerful smoke, and this was one of them. This might take the little smokers down a notch or two though.", "Underratted! (Well, mostly not even MENTIONED!) Bliss for the price. Even whoops the legendary Cohiba Robusto.", "I currently own a LPM April 2008 box. Have smoked 4, so far, not much flavor. Waiting for them to come around. Probably the best looking cigars in my collection.", "This is, without a doubt, my favourite robusto on the market!", "I am totally agree whith Mr. Graham, a 5 stars puro for one of the best smoke in Cuba.Rich and elegant a J.Sukling\u2019s capuccino style", "These are becoming my go to cigar lately.  Perhaps my favorite regular production cuban, especially towards the middle.  A vastly underrated cigar.  I am quickly making my way through a box as I think about smoking them all the time.", "I could not agree more with this review.  Vegas makes an exceptional product and as a Vegas fan I am glad that for the most part this brand is still under the radar.  Many of us veteran cigar smokers know that most cigar smokers will reach for the Montecristo, Cohiba or Romeos when purchasing cigars.  The fact that these sticks are not usually the go to cigar of most new smokers means that their price is still very reasonable compared to other similarly sized cigars.  Every smoker should have a few Famosos in their humidor.", "disappointing, started quite well, bit of leather, bit of sweetness but not much development and lost balance already around the half-way point. not bad but poor value.", "Very impressive. Wonderful build and burn. Smooth, creamy, interesting flavors include leather, some sweetness, nice flavor evolution. In middle some medium cocoa. Very pleased.", "I received one of these from canadian cigar.com cigar club. Not impressed at all. Very poor construction, loose and messy. Makes me wonder if they are selling real Cubans\u2026 Perhaps some purchased in person will yield results more in line with the rest of the reviews", "Discovered these quite by mistake. I bought a 5 pack because they seemed dirt cheap for Cubans. I remember taking the first one out and was surprised at the beauty and the weight they had in my hand.  After the first pull I knew I had stumbled apon gold. Now I have a box in the humi all the time. I have noticed the price creeping up though.  I think the word is getting out but I glad they are still unknown.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more with this review. VR Famosos is good anytime cigar at a reasonable price.  Ash holds extremely well and there\u2019s flavor throughout.  Not a complex cigar. Simple.
