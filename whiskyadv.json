It starts out like a \u201cslightly more gutsy than normal\u201d cask strength, young Ardbeg (e.g., Renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this, there\u2019s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs.\r\nBottom line: It\u2019s an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, I think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other, lesser-peated Ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s.

Glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee).

But it\u2019s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there\u2019s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice.

This is,\r\ntypically, very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. As\r\nit opens there\u2019s dried lemon, oak, dried fig, and (dilute) pencil shavings. The\r\npalate is\u2014typically\u2014sweet and thick, though here with a refreshing sharpness,\r\nlike a mix of wine gums and cider. I\u2019d add a rock or two of ice.

A creamy, mouthcoating whisky, with thick vanilla as the main thread. Quite dry, given its creaminess. I\u2019m also picking up a lot of gin botanicals (especially juniper and orange peel). An interesting enough of a dram, but not something I would drink on a regular basis. \r\n(Fall 2007)\u00a0Reviewed by: John HansellPrint Shelf Talker"}, "Bunnahabhain, 35 year old, 1971 vintage, 44.9% ": {"price": "$700.00", "desc": "Bunnahabhain, 35 year old, 1971 vintage, 44.9% Price: $700.00 Brand: Bunnahabhain Category:  Single Malt ScotchBottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain! \r\n(Winter 2006)\u00a0Reviewed by: John HansellPrint Shelf Talker"}, "Scotch Malt Whisky Society Hunting Hound on Holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989, 51.3% ": {"price": "$225.00", "desc": "Scotch Malt Whisky Society Hunting Hound on Holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989, 51.3% Price: $225.00 Brand: Scotch Malt Whisky Society Category:  Single Malt ScotchFrom the nose you can tell this is a special whisky, with old, dark, lacquered wood, dusty cigar box, and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. On the palate it gets even better, with lush, dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice, salt, and peat smoke. There\u2019s clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. This stunner finishes with a long, slightly spicy, and entirely lovely finish.

A lightweight citrus nose, with vanilla tablet, stewed fruits, watermelon, and a fusty, grained texture. This settles down nicely with a few drops of water for a short finish of light toffee and hints of cocoa.\u00a0\u20ac38(Fall 2015)\u00a0Reviewed by: Jonny McCormickPrint Shelf Talker"}, "Blackadder (distilled at Bowmore), 27 years old, 50.5% ": {"price": "$160.00", "desc": "Blackadder (distilled at Bowmore), 27 years old, 50.5% Price: $160.00 Brand: Bowmore Category:  Single Malt ScotchAmber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore whiskies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. Good, lengthy finish. \r\nStyle: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $160.

Only 519 bottles, all destined for the U.S. It is the richest, chewiest, sweetest, and fruitiest of all the Glenrothes whiskies reviewed here. Deep mahogany color, with notes of toffee apples, waxed fruit, burnt orange, prunes in syrup, and dark chocolate. The intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors, expressing notes of port wine, pot-still rum, and rancio. \r\n(Winter 2006)\u00a0Reviewed by: John HansellPrint Shelf Talker"}}
